<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>S</span>pring</span> was in full tide at Blackburn’s Post, but
Laurentia Blackburn and the four Marys were
confined to the Women’s House by rain. There sat
the girlish Princess surrounded by her handmaidens
in the midst of a rude magnificence which best sets off
a beautiful woman. Her feet were hidden in a
superb polar bearskin which had come down from
the Arctic in trade; and the chair in which she sat
was completely covered by the frosted pelt of a
grizzly, his huge head hanging down over the back.
She was a black-haired Princess with something untamed
about her like the creatures whose pelts decorated
her chamber. Around her neck hung an
astonishing necklace of great pearls strung alternately
with water-worn nuggets of gold. Her black dress
was worked at the neck and wrists with an Indian
design in brightly dyed porcupine quills.</p>

<p>The four Marys were Indian girls, small and
comely, with glistening copper faces, and raven hair
drawn smoothly back from their brows. They were
clad alike in black cotton dresses, with doeskin moccasins
upon their feet; and a stranger would have
been hard put to it to tell them apart. However, he
would presently have perceived that one of them
stood in quite a different relation to her mistress from
the others. This was Mary-Lou who was of the
Beaver tribe, whereas the others were only Slavis.
She was the Princess’ foster sister. She could speak
English. All four girls looked at their mistress with
fear and respect; but only Mary-Lou’s face was
capable of softening with love. She was reading aloud
from “The Lady of the Lake.”</p>

<p>The others were Mary-Belle; Mary-Rose and
Mary-Ann. The first-named crouched in front of the
small fire which had been lighted to mitigate the
dampness out-of-doors. It was her task to see that
it neither went out, nor became hot enough to scorch
the Princess’ face. The other two sat on a bearskin
engaged in embroidering velvet-soft moccasins with
gayly colored silks. None of them could understand
a word of what Mary-Lou was reading from the
book; and the gentle, droning voice was fatally conducive
to sleep. The Princess watched them lazily
through the lowered fringe of her black lashes; and,
when a head was seen to nod, she exploded like a
fire cracker.</p>

<p>“Sit up straight! Your head is going down between
your shoulders! Before you are twenty-five
you will be the shape of a sack of hay! Your husband
if you ever get one at all will look for another
wife!”</p>

<p>It especially terrified the girls to be scolded in the
English they could not understand. This particular
rebuke was addressed to Mary-Belle but all three of
the Slavis cringed, and their dark eyes turned helplessly
this way and that like a frightened deer’s.
Mary-Lou looked apprehensive, too, expecting her
turn to come next.</p>

<p>“Well, go on with the book,” said Loseis crossly.
The name Laurentia, being unmanageable on the
tongue of the Indians, they had given her this one,
which means “little wild duck.”</p>

<p>The tremulous voice resumed.</p>

<p>“Oh, shut the book!” Loseis cried immediately
afterwards. “It is a foolish book! It tires my
ears!”</p>

<p>“Shall I get another book?” faltered Mary-Lou.</p>

<p>“What’s the use? We have read them all. They
are no better than this book. All foolish, goody-goody
books!”</p>

<p>All four red girls sat scared and silent.</p>

<p>Loseis jumped up as if she had strong springs in
her legs. “Can’t you say something, any of you?
Are you all struck dumb? You can chatter fast
enough among yourselves when I am not there!”
She amplified her remarks in the Slavi tongue.</p>

<p>They were struck dumb indeed, then. They looked
at each other helplessly, each one mutely begging her
neighbor to speak.</p>

<p>“Oh, leave me! leave me! you foolish pudding
faces!” cried Loseis, waving her hands. “Or I shall
have to beat you!”</p>

<p>They faded into the kitchen with alacrity. Only
Mary-Lou looked back.</p>

<p>“Mary-Lou, you stay here,” commanded Loseis.
“I’ve got to have somebody to talk to!”</p>

<p>Mary-Lou leaned shyly against the door frame;
pleased at being called back, yet terrified, too. Loseis
paced up and down the room like a slim black panther,
her eyes shooting greenish sparks.</p>

<p>It was a broad, low room with but two tiny windows,
glass being such a difficult article to bring in
seven hundred miles by pack train. There was a
capacious fireplace, cunningly built out of rounded
stones from the creek bed. The log walls had been
plastered with clay, hardened now almost to the consistency
of brick; and overhead was spread a canvas
ceiling cloth to keep in the warmth. Walls and ceiling
had been washed with a warm terra cotta color,
which made a rich background for the beautiful furs.
Over the carved bedstead in the corner was flung a
robe made of hundreds of raccoons’ tails, the black
stripes worked into an elaborate geometrical design.
There were other robes made of otters’ skins, of
lynx paws, of silver foxes. On the walls hung many
beautiful examples of Indian handicraft.</p>

<p>Glancing at the drooping head of the red girl,
Loseis cried: “Mary-Lou, you’ve got as much spirit
as a lump of pemmican! When you sit by the fire I
wonder that you do not melt and run down in
grease!”</p>

<p>Mary-Lou’s head went lower still, and her eyes
filled.</p>

<p>Seeing this, Loseis became angrier still. “There
you go! Of course you’re <span class='it'>good</span>! That’s what makes
me mad! Because I’m not good at all! I’ve got the
temper of a fiend! Well, do you suppose I enjoy
losing it? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I know I ought to say I’m sorry now,
but it sticks in my throat!”</p>

<p>“I not want that,” murmured Mary-Lou. “I am
lovin’ you anyway.”</p>

<p>“Well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I love you, too,” grumbled Loseis,
shamefaced as a boy. “But I wish you weren’t so
humble. It’s bad for me. This is Blackburn’s Post
on Blackburn’s River; all this is Blackburn’s country,
and I’m Blackburn’s daughter. There is nobody to
stand up to me. I am too young to be the mistress.
I don’t know anything.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That white man laughed
at me as one laughs at a child!”</p>

<p>Loseis had stopped her pacing. Her head hung
down. “I ought to have a white woman to tell me
things,” she said wistfully. “In all my life I have
seen but one woman of my own kind. That was the
governess my father brought in for me. I used to
mock her. But now I wish I had her back. She
had nice manners.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. He laughed at me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>She strayed to the second little crooked window,
which was at the end of the room furthest from the
fireplace. It overlooked a natural meadow below,
where the tepees of the Slavis were built upon both
sides of a creek which emptied into the main stream
just beyond. In front of the Post the main river
described a great convex bend, so that Loseis could
look both up-stream and down. This bend was
formed by a bold promontory of a hill which forced
the river to go around its base. The point of this
hill had been sliced off by the water, leaving a precipitous
yellow cut-bank facing the Post. On the summit,
startlingly conspicuous against a group of dark
pine trees, was a fence of white palings enclosing a
tiny plot with a cross rising out of it. By day and by
night too, that grave dominated the Post.</p>

<p>“Ah! if only my mother had lived!” sighed
Loseis.</p>

<p>“Let me read the book again,” suggested Mary-Lou,
to divert her mind.</p>

<p>Loseis shook her head impatiently. She came away
from the window. “I am not in the humor for it.
I guess it is too fine for me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” She resumed her
uneven pacing. “Mary-Lou,” she suddenly cried in
a voice full of pain, “when a man and a woman love
I am sure they do not think such elegant thoughts as
are in that book. Ah! the heart burns a hole in your
breast! It is impossible to think at all!”</p>

<p>The red girl’s eyes followed her, full of compassion.</p>

<p>Observing that look, Loseis said sharply: “You
must not think I am in love with that white man,
Conacher. Oh, no! I was just imagining. I am far
from loving him. I hate him!”</p>

<p>“You are not hating Conacher,” murmured Mary-Lou
sadly. “Why say that to me?”</p>

<p>Loseis stamped her foot. “I tell you I hate him!”
she cried. “That is enough for you! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What
right had he to treat me like a child? I am Blackburn’s
daughter. My father is the master of this
country. And who is this white man? A poor man
in a canoe with only two servants! Nobody ever
heard of him before. My father was angry at his
coming, and I was angry. We do not want white
men coming here to spoil the fur trade!”</p>

<p>Mary-Lou’s silence suggested that she was far
from being convinced.</p>

<p>“A poor man with no outfit at all!” Loseis repeated
louder. “Yet he held his head as if he was as good
as my father! He must be a fool. He talked to me
as if I was anybody at all, and his eyes laughed when
I became angry .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. !” In the midst of her tirade
Loseis suddenly broke down. “Oh, I wish I could
forget him!” she cried, with the angry tears springing
to her eyes.</p>

<p>This sign of weakness gave Mary-Lou the courage
to glide to her mistress, and wreathe her arms about
her. “I think Conacher was a good man,” she whispered.
“His eyes were true.”</p>

<p>These words were very sweet to Loseis; but she
would not openly confess it. However, she gave
Mary-Lou a little squeeze, before withdrawing herself
from her arms. “No,” she said; “I shall stand
by my father. My father is the finest man living.
Conacher is gone. I shall never see him again. I
shall quickly forget him.</p>

<p>“It was only because he took me by surprise,” she
went on with an eagerness in which there was something
pathetically childlike. “When he came paddling
down our river with the two Beaver Indians I was
like one struck on the head. It was like a white
man falling from the skies. No white man ever came
down our river before; and he so young and strong
and full of laughter! He wore no hat; and the sunlight
was snared in his yellow hair. I never saw hair
like that.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>“He like you, too, ver’ moch,” ventured Mary-Lou.
“I was there when he landed. I saw it burn
up like fire in his blue eyes.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw that, too,” murmured Loseis, averting
her face. “But why did he change right away?”</p>

<p>“Because you treat him like poor, dirty Slavi,”
said Mary-Lou. “No white man take that.”</p>

<p>“That is because I was so confused,” whispered
poor Loseis. She suddenly covered her face with
her hands. “Oh, what will he be thinking of me!”
she groaned.</p>

<p>Mary-Lou’s eyes were all sympathy; but she could
think of nothing to say.</p>

<p>Loseis drifted back to the window, where she
stood with her back to Mary-Lou. After awhile,
without turning around, she said in an offhand, experimental
sort of voice: “I have a good mind to see
him again.”</p>

<p>Mary-Lou merely gasped.</p>

<p>“Oh, not meaning anything in particular,” Loseis
said quickly. “There never could be anything between
us. But just to show him that I am not a redskin,
and then leave him.”</p>

<p>“How could you see him?” faltered Mary-Lou.</p>

<p>“He is camped with his outfit alongside the Limestone
Rapids, one hundred miles down,” Loseis went
on in that offhand voice. “He has to break the rocks
with a hammer, and study them where they split.
It is what they call a geologist.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Her assumed
indifference suddenly collapsed. “Let us go to see
him, Mary-Lou,” she blurted out breathlessly. “We
could make it in a long day’s paddling with the current;
three days to come back if we worked hard.
We wouldn’t let him know we had come to see him.
We would say we were hunting.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>“Oh! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” gasped Mary-Lou. “Girls
do not hunt.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t know what <span class='it'>I</span> do!” cried Loseis. “I
<span class='it'>must</span> see him! It kills me to have him thinking that
I am a common, ignorant sort of girl! Let us start
at daybreak to-morrow!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! no!” whispered Mary-Lou, paralyzed by
the very thought. “Blackburn .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Blackburn .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. !”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t say anything until we’d been and
come,” said Loseis coolly. “Anyhow, I’m not afraid
of my father. My spirit is as strong as his. He can’t
shout <span class='it'>me</span> down!”</p>

<p>“No! No!” reiterated the red girl. “If you go
after him like that, he think little of you.”</p>

<p>In her heart Loseis recognized the truth of this,
and she fell into a sullen silence. After awhile she
said: “Then I will make him come back here. I will
send a message.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, not a letter, you foolish
girl!” she added in response to Mary-Lou’s startled
look.</p>

<p>“What kind of message?”</p>

<p>“I will make a little raft and send it floating down
on the current,” said Loseis dreamily. “I will set up
a little stick on the raft, with a ribbon tied to it, a
piece of my hair. I think that will bring him
back .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it float past his camp in the nighttime,”
said Mary-Lou, in her soft, sad voice. “How you
know?”</p>

<p>“Then I will send down two,” said Loseis. “One
in the day and one in the night. He will see one of
them.”</p>

<p>Mary-Lou was astonished by the cleverness of this
idea.</p>

<p>“And then when he comes back,” said Loseis quite
coolly. “I will say that I did not send it. I will say
that it is a custom of the red girls to make offerings to
the Spirit of the River. I think that will make him
feel pretty small. But I shall not laugh at him. Oh,
no! I shall be very polite; polite and proud as Blackburn’s
daughter ought to be. And I shall send him
away again.”</p>

<p>Mary-Lou looked somewhat dubious as to the
feasibility of this program; but held her tongue.</p>

<p>“I shall send him away again,” repeated Loseis with
great firmness, “and after that I shall think of no man
but my father. Before Conacher came my father was
enough for me; and after he has gone my father will
be enough. I am lucky to have such a father; so
handsome and brave and strong-willed.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Loseis
suddenly became dreamy again. “But Conacher was
not afraid of my father. That young man was not
afraid of my father. I have never seen that before.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>Mary-Lou permitted herself to smile tenderly.</p>

<p>Seeing it, Loseis colored up hotly, and became very
firm again. “Never mind that! There is nobody like
my father! He is the finest man in the world! I shall
be a better daughter to him after this. I will do
everything he wants. Ah! my father is like a
king .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. !”</p>

<p>Mary-Lou was suddenly drawn to the end window
by some disquieting sounds from the Slavi village below.
She cried out in surprise: “Jimmy Moosenose is
running between the tepees.”</p>

<p>“What do I care?” said Loseis, annoyed by this interruption.</p>

<p>“He is running fast,” said Mary-Lou, her voice
scaling up. “He speaks to the people; they throw up
their hands; they run after him; they fall down.
There is something the matter!”</p>

<p>Loseis, alarmed, ran to join her at the window.
Together they watched the old Indian come laboring
up the little hill to the grassy bench on which the buildings
of the Post stood. Jimmy Moosenose was a
Beaver Indian, and Blackburn’s right-hand man by reason
of being the only man beside the trader himself,
who could speak the English and the Slavi tongues.
There were no white men at Blackburn’s Post.</p>

<p>When Jimmy passed beyond range of their vision
the girls transferred themselves to the other window.
The Indian struck across the grass straight for their
door. A tatterdemalion crowd of natives and dogs
streamed after him. Fear clutched at Loseis’ brave
heart; and she became as pale as paper. An instant
later Jimmy Moosenose burst in. The others dared
not follow him through the door.</p>

<p>“What is the matter?” demanded Loseis haughtily.</p>

<p>At first the old man could only pant and groan,
while his body rocked in despair. Loseis seized him as
if she would shake out the news by main strength.</p>

<p>“Speak! Speak!” she cried.</p>

<p>“Blackburn .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. !” he gasped. “Blackburn .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. !”</p>

<p>“My father! Hurt! Take me to him!” said Loseis
crisply. She made as if to force her way out through
the crowd.</p>

<p>“They .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. are bringing him,” faltered the old man.</p>

<p>Loseis fell back against the door frame. “Bringing
him?” she echoed faintly.</p>

<p>The old man’s chin was on his breast. “Blackburn
dead!” he said.</p>

<p>Loseis’ arms dropped to her sides; her widened eyes
were like tragic black stars. “Dead?” she repeated in
quite an ordinary voice. “That is impossible!”</p>

<p>Speech came to the old man. “It was the black stallion,”
he cried. “I tell Blackburn, many tam I tell
him that horse kill him some day. He jus’ laugh. He
say: ‘I lak master that horse.’ Wah! what good
master when both are dead! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was the high cut-bank
at Swallow Bend. Blackburn, he spur that horse
to edge of bank to mak’ him rear and wheel. Blackburn
he is laugh lak a boy. The horse is crazy
mad. He put his head down. He no stop. He
jomp over. He jomp clear in the air. Wah!
when I see that, my legs are lak water! When
I look over the bank there is nothing but water.
Both are gone. We get canoe. Down river I see
Blackburn’s leg stickin’ out. We pull him out. His
neck is broke.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>The crowd gathered outside the house, broke with
a common impulse into a weird, wordless chant of
death, the women’s voices rising piercing shrill.
There was no sound of human grief in it; and the
open-mouthed copper-colored faces expressed nothing
either; the bright, flat, black eyes were as soulless as
glass. They pointed their chins up like howling dogs.</p>

<p>Loseis clapped her hands to her head. “Stop that
ungodly noise!” she cried.</p>

<p>Even old Jimmy looked scandalized. “They sing
for Blackburn,” he protested.</p>

<p>“Stop it! Stop it!” she cried. Forcing her way
out, Loseis ran to meet the cortège that was crawling
up the rise towards Blackburn’s house.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span><h1>CHAPTER II<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE BURIAL OF BLACKBURN</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>H</span>ector Blackburn’s</span> own room revealed a
beautiful austerity fitting to the chamber of
death. It was plastered and ceiled like the room of
Loseis, but the color was a cool stone gray. The few
articles of furniture that it contained had all been constructed
in the old style, carved and polished by the
owner himself, who had a taste that way. The lustrous
pelts were more sparingly used here.</p>

<p>The narrow bedstead with its four slender columns
had been dragged into the center of the room. Upon
it lay the body of Hector Blackburn clad in decent
black clothes; his big hands crossed on his breast. Beside
the bed knelt Loseis, her rapt gaze fixed on her
father’s face. Six feet two in height, and forty-eight
inches around the chest, he made a splendid figure of
death. There was not a white thread to be seen in
his spreading black beard, nor in the plentiful wavy
hair of his crown. To be sure, the high red color was
strangely gone out of his transparent cheeks; and the
passionate features were composed into a look of
haughty peace. For sheer manhood, truly a father to
be proud of.</p>

<p>Loseis thought of the feats of strength and daring
that had made his name famous throughout the Northwest
Territories; how he had strangled a full grown
black bear with his naked hands; how he had leaped
from his canoe at the very brink of the American
Falls and had brought safely ashore an Indian who
was clinging to a rock. He had been even more remarkable
for his strength of will. The last of the
great free traders, he had defied the power of the
mighty Company, and had prospered exceedingly. He
held his vast territory against all comers, by the power
of his personality alone. Thinking of these things
Loseis’ mind was confused. There lay his still body
before her eyes, but what had become of the wild
energy which had lately animated it? Surely, surely
that could not be blown out like a candle flame.</p>

<p>Dragging herself to her feet, she went into the adjoining
kitchen. She had had no opportunity to
change her dress, but in an impulse of grief had torn
off the gay embroidery; and now she was all in black
like the corpse. In the kitchen Mary-Lou sat huddled
on the floor, with her arms wrapped around her head.
Jimmy Moosenose stood beside the open door, looking
out, a withered, bent little figure, but still capable
of activity. As Loseis entered he said in an expressionless
voice:</p>

<p>“They have gone.”</p>

<p>“Who?” asked Loseis sharply.</p>

<p>“The people; all the people.”</p>

<p>She ran to the door. It was true; every tepee was
gone from the meadow below. Except for certain
litter abandoned in their haste there was no sign that
a village had ever stood there. The Slavis had taken
flight and vanished like a cloud of insects.</p>

<p>“Where have they gone?” demanded Loseis in astonishment.
Though she had been born amongst
them she did not understand this inscrutable, timid,
savage race. It was impossible for any white man to
know what went on inside their cramped skulls, Blackburn
used to say. He had ruled them without making
any attempt at understanding.</p>

<p>“Gone up river,” muttered Jimmy.</p>

<p>“For why?”</p>

<p>“They moch scare’.”</p>

<p>“But they are familiar with death. Death comes
to all alike.”</p>

<p>Jimmy Moosenose cast an uneasy look towards the
room where the dead man lay. He was near enough
akin to the Slavis to share in their fears. “They think
ver’ powerful strong spirit live in Blackburn’s body,”
he muttered. “Now that spirit free they not know
what it do to them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, what nonsense!” cried Loseis helplessly.</p>

<p>“What we do now?” asked Jimmy fearfully.</p>

<p>Loseis looked him over. “Are you man enough to
ride all night?” she asked brusquely. “The trail is
good.”</p>

<p>“What trail?” asked Jimmy with a terrified face.</p>

<p>“To Fort Good Hope to fetch the parson,” said
Loseis in surprise.</p>

<p>“It is ondred-feefty mile,” faltered Jimmy.</p>

<p>“What of it? Two days to go and two to come.
You can drive three spare horses before you. I don’t
care if you kill them all.”</p>

<p>“I not man enough for that,” said Jimmy shaking
his head.</p>

<p>“Well six days to go and come then. I’d go myself,
but I know you two wouldn’t stay here alone.”</p>

<p>Jimmy’s and Mary-Lou’s frightened faces testified
eloquently to that. Jimmy shook his head. “No
good! No good!” he said. “It is summer time now.
He no keep six days.”</p>

<p>Loseis groaned aloud. In her desperate helplessness
she looked like a little girl. “How can I bury
him without a parson!” she cried.</p>

<p>“You have the parson’s little book,” said Jimmy.
“You can say the prayers from that. It is just as
good.”</p>

<p>Loseis turned her back on them, that they might
not see her childish, twisted face. “Very well,” she
said in a strangled voice; “I will be the parson.”</p>

<p>“What I do now?” asked Jimmy Moosenose.</p>

<p>“First you must make a coffin.”</p>

<p>“There is no planks.”</p>

<p>“Oh, tear down the counter in the store!” cried
Loseis with a burst of irritation. “Must I think of
everything?”</p>

<p>“You tell me how big?” asked Jimmy, with another
glance of sullen terror towards the inner room.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will measure,” said Loseis. “And the coffin
must be covered all over with good black cloth from
the store. Mary-Lou will put it on with tacks. And
lined with white cloth. While you are making it I will
go across the river, and dig the grave. We will bury
him to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“That is well,” said Jimmy with a look of relief.
“Then the people come back.”</p>

<p>“Ah, the people!” cried Loseis with a flash of angry
scorn. “They are well-named Slaves!”</p>

<p>At the end of May in the latitude of Blackburn’s
Post it does not become dark until nearly ten; and it
was fully that hour before Loseis, having completed
her task, returned dog-weary, across the river. During
the balance of the night she sat wide-eyed and dry-eyed
beside her dead, her hands in her lap, planning
in her childlike and passionate way how best to conduct
everything next day with dignity and honor.</p>

<p>At sun-up Jimmy Moosenose was despatched to the
river shore to construct a raft, the light bark canoes
that they possessed not being sufficient to ferry the
coffin across. No flowers were available so early in
the season, and Mary-Lou was set to work to twist a
handsome wreath of the crisp green leaves of the high-bush
cranberry. Neither Jimmy nor Mary-Lou could
be induced to enter Blackburn’s room, so Loseis herself
dragged the completed coffin in beside the bed;
and she unaided, managed somehow to lift the body
into it. In life Hector Blackburn had weighed more
than two hundred pounds. It was Loseis, too, who
nailed the lid on the coffin with an aim no better than
any other woman’s. Those crookedly driven nails
distressed her sorely.</p>

<p>When Jimmy came up from the river, they slipped
short lengths of pole under the coffin, and rolled it to
the door. Outside the house, since there was nothing
in the nature of wheels at Blackburn’s Post, they
hitched an old horse directly to the coffin, and dragged
it at a slow pace over the grass down hill to the river.
Jimmy led the horse, while Loseis and Mary-Lou
walked behind, steadying the coffin with ropes affixed
to each side. During this part of the journey Loseis
was all child. Every time the coffin [word missing in original] over an unevenness
her heart was in her mouth. “Oh! Oh!
Oh!” she cried involuntarily; and her agonized eyes
seemed to add: “My darling! did that hurt you?”</p>

<p>At the river edge they worked the coffin onto the
raft with rollers and short lengths of plank; and
Loseis draped the Post flag upon it, and placed the
green wreath. Jimmy and Mary-Lou propelled the
raft across with long poles, while the slender, black-clad
figure of Loseis stood looking down at the coffin
like a symbolical figure of Bereavement. In her grief-drowned
eyes there was a look of piteous pride, too;
for the black coffin with its flag and green wreath
looked beautiful.</p>

<p>The smooth brown river moved down in silky
eddies; the freshly budded greens of poplar and willow
made the shores lovely, backed by the grave, unchanging
tones of the evergreens. Behind them the
low, solid buildings of the Post crouched on the bench
above the river with a sort of human dignity; before
them rose the steep grassy promontory with the waiting
grave on top. Over their heads smiled the Northern
summer sky of an enchanting tenderness of blue
that is not revealed to lower latitudes.</p>

<p>Landing upon the further shore they caught another
horse—there was no lack of horses at Blackburn’s
Post. In order to drag the coffin up the rough,
steep hill it was necessary to construct a travois of
poles to lift the front end clear of the ground. The
horse was fastened between the poles as between
shafts. At the top of the hill Loseis had removed the
palings; and the new grave yawned beside the old one.
She had dug the shallow hole with sloping ends, that
the horse might walk right through, leaving his burden
in its place.</p>

<p>The animal was then liberated; and Loseis stood on
one side, prayer-book in hand, with Jimmy Moosenose
and Mary-Lou facing her on the other. It was a
meagerly attended burial for the great lord of that
country. Loseis read the noble prayers in a grave
voice charged with emotion. The sound of it caused
the tears to run silently down the smooth cheeks of
Mary-Lou; but Jimmy merely looked uncomfortable.
The feelings of white people were strange to him. He
had given his master a doglike devotion while he
lived; but he was dead now, and that was an end to it.</p>

<p>“Man that is born of woman hath but a short time
to live and is full of misery,” read the brave young
voice. “He cometh up and is cut down like a flower;
he fleeth as it were a shadow, and never continueth
in one stay. In the midst of life we are in death; of
whom may we seek for succour but of Thee, O Lord,
who for our sins art justly displeased?”</p>

<p>When she came to the end of the service, Loseis
dropped the book and involuntarily broke into an extempore
prayer, standing with straight back and lifted
face like an Indian, her arms at her sides. Her words
were hardly couched in the same humble strain as
those of the book; but the passionate sincerity of the
speaker redeemed them from irreverence.</p>

<p>“O God, this is my father. He was a strong man,
God, and you must make allowances for him. You
gave him a proud heart and a terrible anger when he
was crossed, and it would not be fair to judge him
like common men. He could have done anything he
wanted here, because he was the master, but he was
always square. Every season he paid the Indians half
as much again for their fur as the Company would
pay, and that is why the Company traders spoke evil
of him. He was hard and stern to the Indians, but
that was the only thing they could understand. How
else could you deal with a tribe of slaves? Be merciful
to my father, O God! for he would never ask mercy
for himself; and let him see my mother again, for that
was all he wanted. Amen.”</p>

<p>Jimmy Moosenose picked up the spade with a
businesslike air, and threw a clod on the coffin. At
the dreadful sound that it gave forth, a sharp cry
broke from Loseis. She wrapped her arms about her
head and fled away down the hill.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span><h1>CHAPTER III<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE SLAVES WITHOUT A MASTER</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>W</span>hen</span> the three mourners landed again on their
own side of the river, Jimmy and Mary-Lou
looked at Loseis at a loss. What to do next?</p>

<p>Rousing herself, Loseis said wearily: “Jimmy, you
must fix up the counter in the store. Fix it with split
poles until we can make some plank. Mary-Lou,
fetch a hatchet and come with me.”</p>

<p>On the river shore some hundred yards downstream,
hidden by a clump of willows in case Jimmy
Moosenose should be inclined to spy on what they
were doing, Mary-Lou under Loseis’ instructions built
a tiny raft out of dead branches. To the raft Loseis
fixed a little pole to the top of which she tied a
streamer of black. She launched the raft on the current,
and with big, childish eyes watched it float
around the bend.</p>

<p>“I am not sending for Conacher to come to me,”
she said haughtily to Mary-Lou. “But when a white
man dies it is customary to let men know.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To-night
I will push off another one. One or the other
he will see.”</p>

<p>Within an hour the Slavis returned as mysteriously
as they had departed. They must have had an outlook
posted to report upon the burial of Blackburn. To
Loseis their actions seemed perfectly senseless; for
Jimmy had said it was the spirit of Blackburn that
they dreaded, yet as soon as his body was hidden underground
their fears departed. They set up the
tepees in their former places, and went about their
usual occupations as if nothing had happened. Loseis’
breast burned with anger; and she wanted to go
down and give them a piece of her mind. However,
Jimmy dissuaded her.</p>

<p>“No good! No good!” he said. “It is over now.
They not understand white man’s ways.”</p>

<p>There was a sharp ring of anxiety in his voice that
caused Loseis to stare in haughty surprise. She thoroughly
despised the Slavis. However, she said nothing.
She and Mary-Lou went off to their house to
sleep.</p>

<p>Down on the flat it was the women who were erecting
the tepee poles, and drawing the covers over them.
They no longer used skins for this purpose, Blackburn
having persuaded them of the superior advantages of
the canvas that he sold. In the same way the whole
tribe had learned to wear white men’s clothes out of
the store. While the women worked, the men sat in
groups smoking and talking in that queer clicking
tongue that few white men have ever mastered.
Their talk was light and punctuated with laughter;
but it was clear from their uneasy glances towards the
white man’s buildings that they were not speaking
their hearts. As a matter of fact the Indians are quite
as adept in insincere small talk as their white brethren.</p>

<p>From time immemorial the Slavis have been known
as a small, weak people; and this particular branch,
cut off from their fellows on the distant shores of
Blackburn’s River had further degenerated as a result
of too close inter-marriage. They were a weedy
lot, and like all weak peoples, shifty-eyed. As is always
the case, the men showed up worse; hollow chests and
spindle shanks were the rule; the whole tribe could
not produce one stalwart, handsome youth. But they
were not poverty-stricken. They all wore good
clothes, and lived in new, weather-proof tepees. They
hunted the best fur country in all the North, and for
twenty years Blackburn had jealously guarded it for
them.</p>

<p>From where they sat Jimmy Moosenose could be
seen splitting poles in front of the store, and carrying
them in. Without appearing to, the men were all
watching him. The groups of talkers fell silent.
They could not meet each other’s eyes. A curious
look of dread flickered in their faces; that which had
directed the whole course of their lives for so many
years had been suddenly removed, and they were all
at a stand.</p>

<p>By twos and threes they began to drift up the grassy
rise, their vacant eyes drifting this way and that.
There was something peculiarly ominous about their
purposelessness, their lack of direction. They
squatted down on their hunkers, making a rough semi-circle
about Jimmy. They no longer spoke among
themselves, nor did any volunteer to help Jimmy; they
simply squatted and stared at him with their unwinking
animal-like eyes. Jimmy affected to take no notice
of them; but his forehead became moist with a sudden
fear. He was reminded that he was of alien
blood to these people, and that they were thirty to
his one. And there were five times that number more
in their summer camp at Blackburn’s Lake.</p>

<p>At length the silence, the unwinking stares became
more than Jimmy could bear. “Where is Etzooah?”
he asked, affecting indifference.</p>

<p>Etzooah was one whom Jimmy suspected of being
a trouble maker. He was a bigger man than the
others; and was said to have Cree blood. More than
once in the past his sharpness had displeased Blackburn,
who, however, tolerated him because he was the
best hunter in the tribe.</p>

<p>“Etzooah gone to the lake to see a girl,” said one.</p>

<p>From the way the others grinned it was clear this
was a lie. Jimmy was much troubled that they
grinned openly in his face. Had Blackburn been in
the store behind him they would never have done that.
Jimmy glanced desirously in the direction of the
Women’s House, and his watchers marked that
glance.</p>

<p>One said, affecting the stupid look of a crafty
schoolboy: “Are you the trader now?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Jimmy, “Loseis is the mistress here.”</p>

<p>The ugly little men bared their blackened teeth; and
a squall of laughter rocked them on their heels.
There was no true merriment in the sound. It ended
as suddenly as it began. It struck an icy fear into
Jimmy’s breast. He was all alone; all alone.</p>

<p>“Go back to your lodges!” he said, drawing himself
up, and imitating the voice of Blackburn.</p>

<p>They neither moved nor spoke; but squatted there
staring at him.</p>

<p>He dared not repeat the order. Shouldering his
poles, he started into the store. Of one accord the
Slavis rose, and came pushing through the door after
him. Flinging down his poles, Jimmy spread out his
arms to bar their way.</p>

<p>“Get out!” he cried. “There is no trading to-day.”</p>

<p>Keeping their eyes fixed on his, they continued to
push in. They walked right into Jimmy, forcing him
back. What was he to do? His instinct told him that
the moment he showed fight it would be all up with
him. He picked up one of his poles and started to
nail it into place, grumbling to himself, and making
believe to ignore them.</p>

<p>They stood about the store watching him with affected
sleepiness through half-closed eyes. One of
them, keeping his eyes fixed on Jimmy, thrust a hand
into an opened box and pulled it out full of dried apricots.
All the instincts of thirty years of trading were
outraged by this act, and Jimmy forgot his fears.</p>

<p>“Put it back!” he cried, brandishing the hammer.
“Get out, you thieves! You half-men, you dirty
slaves!”</p>

<p>None moved, nor changed a muscle of his face.
The man with the apricots held them in his hand, waiting
to see what Jimmy would <span class='it'>do</span>. What he said was
nothing to them. He might as well have been storming
at the wind. Finally, half beside himself with
rage, Jimmy ran to the back of the store where the
guns were kept.</p>

<p>Instantly the little men sprang into noiseless activity.
One picked up a short length of pole, and darting
after Jimmy on soft pads like a lynx, hit him over
the head with it, before he could turn. In a flash
they were all about him, their dark faces fixed in
hideous grins, each trying to strike. They used tinned
goods for weapons; one secured the hammer; one
snatched up a heavy steel trap which he held poised
aloft waiting for Jimmy’s head to appear. The whole
mass swayed from this side to that, toppling over the
goods on either side. Jimmy went down, and they
had to bend over to hit him. They were as voiceless
as squirming insects. There was no sound but the
sickening blows that fell.</p>

<p>When they finally drew back a shapeless huddle was
revealed, lying in blood. Panic overtook the feather-headed
Slavis, and they ran out of the store to look
anxiously in the direction of the Women’s House.
Nothing stirred there. They returned inside the
store. They did not consult together, but appeared
to act as instinctively as animals. There was a window
at the back of the store. They pried it out frame
and all, and hastily shoved the broken body through
the hole, careless of where it fell. The instant it was
out of sight they forgot about it, nor did they trouble
to put the window back.</p>

<p>Alone in the store, the Slavis betrayed a curious
timidity. It seemed as if the ghost of Hector Blackburn
restrained them still. They overran the place
like ants, peering into everything, stroking the objects
that they desired, but forbearing as yet to pick them
up. At intervals panic seized them, and they swept
in a cloud to the door to look over towards the Women’s
House. Some of the Slavi women and children
had been attracted from the tepees. These never
ventured through the doors, but hung about outside,
expressing no concern one way or the other; merely
waiting to see how it all turned out.</p>

<p>At length one man ventured to eat of the dried apricots;
another split the top of a can of peaches with a
hatchet; and instantly looting became general. Boxes
were smashed, and bags ripped open, pouring their
precious contents on the floor. Food in the North is
not to be lightly wasted. Articles of clothing were the
chief prizes; the only way to secure them was to put
them on, one on top of another. Sometimes two
pulled at the same garment, snarling at each other.
But they never fought singly. They were dangerous
only in the mass.</p>

<p>In the middle of this scene suddenly appeared
Loseis, her black eyes blazing. A terrified Mary-Lou
cringed at her heels. Every Indian in the store, dropping
what he was about, instantly became as immobile
and watchful as a surprised animal. Loseis glared
about her speechless. She was as much aghast as she
was angry, for such a scene was beyond anything she
had ever conceived of. But she was not afraid. She
turned to the door.</p>

<p>“Jimmy! Jimmy!” she called peremptorily.</p>

<p>She waited in vain for an answer.</p>

<p>“Where is Jimmy?” she demanded haughtily.</p>

<p>None answered her.</p>

<p>She dispatched Mary-Lou in search of him.</p>

<p>The situation was beyond words. Loseis’ eyes
darted silent lightnings at one man after another.
The scattered Slavis slyly edged together. No single
pair of eyes could meet hers, but she could not
cow more than one man at a time; and the bright, inhuman
eyes of the others remained fixed on her face.</p>

<p>Finally with a magnificent gesture Loseis pointed to
the door. “Get out!” she said.</p>

<p>No man moved.</p>

<p>That was a terrible moment for the high-spirited
girl. A look of astonishment appeared in her eyes.
Suddenly her face crimsoned with rage; she flew at
the nearest man, and started pommeling him with her
little fists. The man ducked under her blows, and
sought to evade her. He pulled another man in front
of him; whereupon Loseis transferred her blows to
this one. All the others looked on with faces like
masks. And so it went. The mysterious prestige of
the white blood sanctified her, and they dared not
strike back; they resisted her with that senseless animal
obstinacy that drives masters mad with rage.
They were satisfied to let her pommel them, knowing
that she must tire of it in the end. And what then?
It was like fighting a cloud of flies. They would not
be driven out of the store. When one was driven
out, as soon as Loseis went for another, he returned.</p>

<p>She drew off at last. In that moment she knew
the unspeakable agony of an imperious will that finds
itself balked. She nearly died of her rage. But she
faced it out. She admitted to herself that she was
balked. The last two days had matured her. Fortunately
for her, under all the passion and wilfulness
of her nature there was a solid substratum of commonsense.
Commonsense warned her that it would be
fatal to make the least move in the direction of the
guns at the back of the store. She could not force
the senseless savages to obey her; well, commonsense
suggested that she use guile. Loseis had an inspiration.</p>

<p>Just inside the door of the store, behind a rough
screen of wood, Blackburn had a little desk with a
cover that lifted up. Loseis went to it, and took out
a sizable book stoutly bound in gray linen and red
leather. Every Slavi knew that book. It was Blackburn’s
ledger. Loseis appeared around the screen
carrying the ledger; and up-ending a box beside the
door, sat herself upon it with the book spread on her
knees.</p>

<p>“You wish to trade?” she said to the men at large.
“It is good. Take what you want. I will put it down
in the book.”</p>

<p>The eyes of the Slavis bolted; and they moved uneasily.
The spell of their strangeness was broken.
To their simple minds there was magic in those
scratches by which white men’s thoughts might be conveyed
to any distance that they chose; or stored up in
a book to be brought out years afterwards unchanged.
In particular, Blackburn’s ledger had always been held
in superstitious awe as the source of his “strong medicine.”</p>

<p>Loseis looked at the man nearest her, and thumbed
the pages of the book. “Mahtsonza,” she said; “a
Stetson hat; two skins. A Mackinaw coat; five skins.
Wah! you have two coats? Ten skins!”</p>

<p>Mahtsonza began to slide out of his stolen clothing.</p>

<p>Loseis turned to the next. “Ahchoogah; a bag of
rice; one skin. The bag is spoiled, and you must pay
for all. You can carry it away.”</p>

<p>There was a sudden rush for the door; but Loseis,
springing up, barred the way. “I have all your
names,” she cried. “Whatever is taken or spoiled will
be written down, and all must pay a share!”</p>

<p>Then she stood aside and let them slink by, a
ridiculously crestfallen crowd of little bravoes.</p>

<p>For the moment Loseis had won—but at no small
cost. The instant they were out, the reaction set in.
All the strength seemed to run out of her limbs; she
sank down on the box covering her face with her
hands. The fact of her appalling solitariness was
made clear to her. She dared not look into the future.</p>

<p>Presently Mary-Lou came back. “No can find
Jimmy,” she said. “Nobody see him.”</p>

<p>Proceeding to the rear of the store to survey the
damage, the two girls came upon the wet, dark stain
spreading over the floor. The instant she saw it,
Loseis knew what had happened and went very still;
but Mary-Lou cried out: “Look, the window is out!”
and must needs stick her head through the hole to
look.</p>

<p>A piercing shriek broke from the red girl; she fell
back half witless with terror into Loseis’s arms.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span><h1>CHAPTER IV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>AT FORT GOOD HOPE</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>t Fort Good Hope</span> on the big river, the free
trader Andrew Gault and his financial backer
David Ogilvie, stood by the flagpole concluding their
business, while the steam-launch <span class='it'>Courier</span> waited in the
stream below to carry Ogilvie down river.</p>

<p>Outside of the towns, Fort Good Hope was the
most enterprising and progressive Post in that country.
The original log buildings were now used as
bunk-houses for the half-breed employees; while on
one side rose the magnificent dwelling of the trader,
built of clapboards in the “outside” style and having
fancy porches with turned pillars; and on the other
side the equally modern store with plate glass windows
imported at God knows what expense and
trouble; and a huge sign. This sign was the occasion
of considerable humor throughout the country, since
there was nobody who required to be told whose store
it was.</p>

<p>This was by no means all of the improvements at
Fort Good Hope. Gault had built and now operated
a steamboat on the river, which connected with a line
of wagons across the ninety-mile portage to Caribou
Lake, and so kept him in touch with the world. By
means of the steamboat he had imported an electric
light plant, a sawmill and a steam process mill for
grinding and bolting flour. The land along the river
was rich, and Gault had established farmers there.
They were only frozen out about one year in three;
and that was their loss, not Gault’s. His flour, raised
and milled on the spot, he was able to sell to the Indians
at an enormous profit.</p>

<p>In spite of all this, when Gault made up his accounts
with Ogilvie, the financier pursed up his mouth in a
grudging fashion, and Gault who was a bitter, proud
man, ground his teeth with rage.</p>

<p>“Your improvements are fine, fine,” said Ogilvie
dryly; “the Post looks almost like a village on the railway.
But my dear man, all this only returns a beggarly
ten or fifteen per cent on the investment. I need
not point out to you that our company is accustomed
to receive two profits on every transaction. In other
words we do not want the cash that you remit to us;
we want fur. And I’m sorry to see that your consignments
of fur have been growing less every year.”</p>

<p>The trader was silent out of anger; and Ogilvie
went on: “The history of all the old posts is the same.
With the advance of civilization the fur is always retreating.
With your steamboats and your sawmills
you are hastening the process, my dear Gault. At the
other old posts as the fur recedes they reach after it
with sub-posts and trading stations. Why don’t you do
something of the sort? You are in a better strategic
position than any of them, because off to the northwest
here you have a vast land that is still written down
unexplored on the maps. Why don’t you get that fur?”</p>

<p>“As you know,” muttered Gault, “on the northwest
I am blanketed by Hector Blackburn.”</p>

<p>Ogilvie shrugged. “Why remain blanketed?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“What do you propose?” asked Gault bitterly.</p>

<p>“Oh, the specific measures must be left to you,” said
Ogilvie hastily. “You are the man on the ground.
But of course our company will back you up in anything
you undertake. The old rough stuff has gone
out of fashion, but the principle is the same. To put
it bluntly, Gault: buy him out or drive him out.”</p>

<p>“The entire resources of our company would not
buy him out,” said Gault. “The man is drunk with
pride at having the name of the last free trader.”</p>

<p>“Well then?” said Ogilvie meaningly.</p>

<p>“As to driving him out, I mean to do that; but I
must await my opportunity. He’s in an almost impregnable
position.”</p>

<p>“Why did you let him get in such a position?” murmured
Ogilvie. “You were on the ground first.”</p>

<p>“He had all the luck,” said Gault bitterly.</p>

<p>“Why is his position so impregnable?”</p>

<p>“Well, for one thing he has a tribe of Indians completely
under his thumb. Those are the Slavis, the
most ignorant and primitive race of them all. Once
they covered this whole country, but have gradually
been pushed back by the Crees and other tribes. They
have some other name, but I don’t know what it is.
All the other Indians call them Slavis. Well, Blackburn
has got this people penned up in his own country,
where no whites can communicate with them. He deliberately
trades on their ignorance and superstition.
He has persuaded them that I am a devil and that
black magic is worked at this Post, and no power under
Heaven can persuade them to come within fifty
miles of me.”</p>

<p>Ogilvie laughed. “Not bad,” he said. “Why don’t
you outbid him for fur? That might work a miracle.”</p>

<p>“I have tried it,” said Gault grimly. “He is willing
to go higher than the company is willing to let me go.”</p>

<p>“But surely a year or two of that, with his ruinously
expensive transport would break him,” said Ogilvie.</p>

<p>“Blackburn is as rich as Crœsus,” said Gault bitterly;
“and he’d risk every cent of it to beat me.
What is more, he is entirely independent of transport.
When they run out of food over there, he sends his
cheaper furs to me for flour, and I have to take them,
because I need the fur. Blackburn trades horses for
fur. He has in the triangle between his river, the
foothills and the Mud River, a vast natural range for
horses. God knows how many thousands of head he
has. The fame of them has spread all over the country.
He can afford to sell them cheap since they cost
him nothing. The Sikannis Indians bring their fur
all the way from British Columbia to trade for horses.
The Indians from Wabiscaw and eastward cross the
river here right under my nose, carrying their fur to
Blackburn for horses.”</p>

<p>“You say you are awaiting your opportunity,” said
Ogilvie; “how will you know when that comes?”</p>

<p>“I have a spy at Blackburn’s Post,” said Gault. “It
wasn’t easy to find him, because nobody can speak
their damned language but Blackburn. This man,
Etzooah, is the son of a Cree father and a Slavi
mother, and is able to mix with the Slavis as one of
themselves.”</p>

<p>“What good do you expect that to do you?”</p>

<p>“Etzooah talks to the Slavis in my interest. However,
that is not what I am counting on.” Gault
smiled disagreeably. “Blackburn is a headstrong, passionate
man, and a hard drinker. He treats the Slavis
like dogs. He believes there is nobody to call him to
account. Some day he will go too far. Then I’ll have
the law on him. He runs his whole show single-handed.
Won’t tolerate a white man near him. Consequently
if he were removed, even for a while, the
whole thing would fall into confusion. That will be
my chance.”</p>

<p>“I have heard there was a daughter,” said Ogilvie
idly.</p>

<p>“Yes, a black-haired she-devil in her father’s own
image!” said Gault.</p>

<p>“Well, good-by until next Spring,” said Ogilvie.
“I wish you every success. If Blackburn were out of
the way this would be the greatest Post in the country.”
He looked around him with assumed regret.
“You have made so many improvements it would be
a pity if we had to close you out. But of course
we must have the fur.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Good-by.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Good-by.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>Gault watched him go with rage and bitterness
making his heart black. Damn all financiers and
officials who fattened on the labors of better men than
themselves! Gault had not told him the full history
of his relations with Hector Blackburn; but no doubt
Ogilvie knew anyhow, for it was common gossip
throughout the fur country; how Gault and Blackburn
had come to grips a dozen times during the past
twenty years, and Gault had been invariably and
humiliatingly worsted. He too, was a ruthless and
determined man, and when he thought over these
things it was almost more than he could bear.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>Andrew Gault was a bachelor, living alone in his
monstrosity of a yellow clapboarded house. A handsome,
lean, grizzled man in his early fifties, with a
cold and polished manner that one would hardly expect
to find in a fur-trader. It was a point of pride
with Gault never to allow himself to go slack. For
all he was seven hundred miles from town, his house
was well-furnished, his servants well-trained. These
last were of the Cree tribe, a handsomer and more intelligent
race than the miserable Slavis, but not so
manageable.</p>

<p>Some days after the visit of Ogilvie, Gault, having
finished his breakfast, remained sitting at the table,
gloomily staring at the cloth, and abstractedly crumbling
pellets of bread. His mind was forever traveling
the same weary round without finding a way out.
Thoughts of Hector Blackburn poisoned his very being.
How to get back at him; how to ruin him. Ah!
his enemy seemed to be intrenched at every point!
Blackburn could laugh at him. Stronger measures
must be taken now, for certain ruin stared Gault in
the face. Somehow, Blackburn’s own weapons must
be turned against him. Could not the ignorant Slavis
be incited to rebellion? They must have their own
medicine men or conjurers, and these fellows could
generally be bought. He, Gault, must get hold of
Etzooah before the next fur season set in.</p>

<p>Toma, Gault’s old house-servant entered the room.
He was excited. “Wah! Man come from Blackburn’s
Post,” he announced.</p>

<p>To Gault this had the effect of a miracle. He
sprang to his feet. “What man?” he cried.</p>

<p>“Name Etzooah,” said Toma.</p>

<p>“Bring him to me! Bring him to me!” shouted
Gault. “Let none else come in until I call.”</p>

<p>Toma shuffled out of the room, and Gault had time
to compose himself. It was very bad policy of course,
for a white man to betray his emotion before a native.
The trader reseated himself.</p>

<p>Etzooah came sidling around the door, awe-struck
at finding himself admitted to the great house, and exhibiting
a witless grin. He was a small man with a
bullet head set between muscular shoulders. His thick
coarse hair was cut straight across his forehead in the
Slavi style, and straight around at his neck behind.
He wore good store clothes with a gay worsted sash
about his middle. For business reasons the spy
affected an air of good-natured, giggling imbecility,
which would deceive nobody who knew the Indians.
His little eyes were as quick and sharp as a weasel’s.</p>

<p>“What news?” asked Gault curtly.</p>

<p>“Blackburn is dead,” said Etzooah, laughing heartily
and silently.</p>

<p>Gault caught his breath. For an instant he lost all
self-control. The upper part of his body sprawled
across the table; his eyes seemed to start from his
head. “Dead?” he gasped; “dead? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You are
sure?”</p>

<p>“I see him die,” said Etzooah, with silent pantomime
of delight. “Him black horse jomp over high
cut-bank. Him neck broke. Him drown afterwards.
When him pull out of river him head loose lak a berry
on the bush.” Etzooah illustrated.</p>

<p>A shock of joy does not kill. Gault stood up
straight and arrogant; a warm color came into his
pale cheeks, and his eyes shone like a boy’s again.
“By God! this news is good to my ears!” he cried.
“You shall never go hungry, Etzooah.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. When
did it happen?”</p>

<p>“Two days,” said Etzooah. “At noon spell.
Right away I tak’ two horses; ride all night. Only
stop for one little sleep yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Did anybody know you came?”</p>

<p>“No. I sneak away.”</p>

<p>“Hm!” said Gault stroking his chin. “Then they’ll
know that you were my man all the time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh,
what does it matter now! Everything is in my hands.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Had Blackburn sent his fur out yet?”</p>

<p>“No. Roundin’ up pack horses when him kill.”</p>

<p>“Then that is <span class='it'>my</span> fur now! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What will the
Slavis do without their master?”</p>

<p>Etzooah shrugged expressively. “No can tell.
Slavis lak crazy children. Not know what they do.
Maybe they run wild now; kill the girl and steal the
store goods. No can tell.”</p>

<p>Gault’s face darkened. “By God!” he cried. “If
the Slavis get out of hand, it would bring in the police.
I don’t want the police nosing into this. I will ride
back to-day. Toma! Toma! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You, Etzooah,
eat in my kitchen, and take a sleep.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Toma,
you——————!”</p>

<p>The old man came shuffling in.</p>

<p>“Fetch Moale from the store. Bestir yourself!
Afterwards get out my riding-suit, my saddlebags, my
traveling blankets, and all things necessary for a
journey!”</p>

<p>Joe Moale was the “bookkeeper” at Fort Good
Hope, otherwise Gault’s second in command. Technically
a white man, a flavor of the red race clung
about him; he was probably a quarter breed. He was
reputed to be a relative of Gault’s. An educated man,
as able and intelligent as any white man in the company’s
employ, he was as inscrutable as an Indian.
He was a well-built man of middle height, not uncomely
in his wooden fashion. It was impossible to
guess his exact age, but he was much younger than
the trader. He served Gault with absolute and unquestioning
faithfulness, but there was no affection in
the glance that he bent on his master. With true
redskin patience he was waiting for Gault to die.</p>

<p>“Blackburn is dead!” cried Gault, striding up and
down in his dark exultation.</p>

<p>“The news has already spread about the Post,” said
Moale, unmoved.</p>

<p>“Can we both get away together?” asked Gault.</p>

<p>“Why not? The fur is all in. At this season Claggett
can keep the store.”</p>

<p>“Then I want you to come with me. We must start
within an hour. Round up the four smartest lads
you can put your hands on, and a dozen of our best
horses. We must make a good appearance, you understand.
Six of us will be more than enough to
handle the beggarly Slavis.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Blackburn is dead!”
he cried for the mere pleasure of repeating the words.
“And his business is ours!”</p>

<p>“What will you do about the girl?” asked Moale
stolidly.</p>

<p>“Oh, a miss of eighteen,” said Gault contemptuously.
“She will give me no trouble .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ll be
her guardian, her trustee,” he added with a satanic
smile.</p>

<p>“She’ll be rich,” said Moale.</p>

<p>“Not when I’m through with her.”</p>

<p>“I’m not referring to the Post, nor the horses,” said
Moale. “Blackburn sends out near a hundred thousand
dollars worth of fur per annum. He don’t import
but a fraction of that in goods. The balance
must be salted down somewhere.”</p>

<p>Gault stopped and stared. A new light of cupidity
broke in his face. “Why, sure!” he said, a little bemused
with the glittering picture that rose before
his mind’s eye. “My mind must be wandering!
Shouldn’t wonder if it amounted to a million! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
He went on muttering to himself: “It would be the
best way anyhow. Nobody could question what I did
then. And I shouldn’t be doing it for the company
neither but for myself!” His voice suddenly rang
out. “By God! I’ll marry the girl!”</p>

<p>Going to the sideboard, he examined his face anxiously
in the mirror. “Joe,” he said, “if you didn’t
know my age, how old would you call me?”</p>

<p>Whatever Moale’s thoughts might have been, he
concealed them. “About thirty-eight,” he said.</p>

<p>“Hardly that,” said Gault confidently. “If it
wasn’t for the gray in my hair I could pass for thirty-five
easy. I wish to God I could lay my hands on
some hair dye.”</p>

<p>“I can make a good black dye out of nutgalls,”
said Moale.</p>

<p>“Well, go to it!” cried Gault. “Get a move on
you now. We must sleep at Blackburn’s Post to-morrow
night .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, my God! suppose we were to
find that the Slavis had got out of hand and murdered
the girl!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span><h1>CHAPTER V<br/> <span class='sub-head'>YELLOW-HEAD</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>L</span>oseis</span> sat on a bench at the door of the store.
The Princess was very pale, and her lips were
pressed tight together. In her brave, proud eyes was
to be seen the piteous, questioning look of a child: Why
must I suffer so much? Just inside the door of the
store Mary-Lou was squatting on the floor with her
head buried in her arms. Loseis had to be brave for
both.</p>

<p>The buildings at Blackburn’s Post formed three
sides of a grassy square, the fourth side being open to
the river. The store faced the river, flanked by a
warehouse on each side. On Loseis’ right was the
Women’s House, and opposite it Blackburn’s House
and his stable. All the buildings were constructed of
logs, and roofed with sods, now sprouting greenly.
Nothing could have been rougher, nevertheless the
buildings seemed to belong in that place; and there
was a pleasing harmony in their arrangement. Out
in the middle of the grassy square rose a tall flagpole.</p>

<p>Loseis and Mary-Lou had taken up their abode in
the store. At this season of the year the stock of
goods was much depleted, and Loseis was in no great
concern about losing what was left; but knowing the
Indian nature, she was well aware that if the Slavis
were not prevented from helping themselves, they
would soon get out of hand altogether.</p>

<p>In the store there was plenty of food to their hand;
as for water, Loseis obtained it after dark by creeping
down to the small stream where it wound around
the flank of the little plateau. All night a little lamp
burned in the window of the store. Night-attacks
were not at all in the Slavis’ line; but Loseis wished
them to be reminded whenever they looked that way,
that somebody was on guard. All day the door of
the store was allowed to stand open; while the two
girls permitted themselves to be seen passing unconcernedly
in and out, and performing their household
tasks out in front. Their only defense lay in this appearance
of unconcern.</p>

<p>Three days and three nights of cruel anxiety had
passed, and the fourth night was approaching. Loseis
had not reflected much on her situation; it simply
wouldn’t bear thinking about. She had just gone
ahead and done what came to her hand at the moment.
During the first night the body of Jimmy Moosenose
had disappeared. The Slavis either buried it hastily
in some out of the way spot, or threw it in the river.
Like the children they were, they believed that if only
the body were hidden the crime could never be
brought home to them.</p>

<p>None of the Slavis had ever approached the store.
Apparently they were pursuing their ordinary avocations
as if nothing had happened; the dogs and the
children fought; the women fished, cooked the meals,
and made moccasins; the men loafed and smoked. As
she looked down at them the sight of their inhuman
indifference caused Loseis’ heart to burn. Senseless
animals! she ejaculated to herself a dozen times a day.</p>

<p>Mary-Lou came out of the store. The Indian girl
was unable either to apply her hands to any work or
to sit still. Her copper face had become grayish, and
her eyes were distracted with terror. She looked
down over the tepees, biting her lip.</p>

<p>“More have come,” she said hoarsely.</p>

<p>“You imagine that,” said Loseis. “I have seen nobody
come.”</p>

<p>“They not let you see them come,” said Mary-Lou.
“Sleep in their friends’ tepees. But I see more canoes
in the creek.”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?” said Loseis with a grand parade
of indifference. “They’re harmless.”</p>

<p>“Like coyotes,” said Mary-Lou. “They are sitting
down to wait for us to die!”</p>

<p>Loseis sprang up nervously. Her face was working.
“You are like a raven croaking all day!” she
cried. “That does no good!”</p>

<p>Mary-Lou caught hold of Loseis imploringly.
“Let us go from here!” she begged. “All night I
listen! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. My brain is turned to ice. I don’t know
what I am doing! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As soon as it is dark let us
take horses and go. They not know until to-morrow
that we are gone. Never catch us then. It is only
ondred-feefty mile to Fort Good Hope.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>Loseis detached the clinging hands. “It’s no good
going on this way,” she said harshly. “I will not run
from Slavis.”</p>

<p>Mary-Lou fell on her knees, clutching Loseis’ skirt,
babbling incoherently in her terror. Loseis raised her
face to the sky, clenching her teeth in despair. How
much of this have I got to stand? she was thinking.</p>

<p>Then she saw the Slavis begin to run to the river
bank. “Look! Look!” she cried. “Something is
coming up the river!”</p>

<p>Mary-Lou scrambled to her feet. Whatever it was
in the river, it was approaching close under the bank.
They could see nothing. The Slavis were yelling and
pointing.</p>

<p>“It is Conacher!” screamed Mary-Lou.</p>

<p>“NO! No! No!” cried Loseis in a voice as taut
as an over-stretched violin string. “It is just a Slavi
coming up river. Anything is enough to get them going.”</p>

<p>“It is Conacher!” screamed Mary-Lou. “If it was
a Slavi they would run down to the water. They stop
on the bank. They are a little afraid. See! they look
at us. It is somebody for us. It is Conacher!”</p>

<p>Loseis felt that if she allowed herself to believe it
and was then disappointed, it would kill her. “No!
No!” she said faintly. “It is too soon!”</p>

<p>And then the yellow head rose above the bank.</p>

<p>Loseis collapsed suddenly on the bench and burst
into tears. Her whole body was shaken. Mary-Lou
fell on her knees with a scream of joy. “Conacher!
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Conacher!”</p>

<p>Loseis struggled hard to regain her self-control.
“Stop that noise!” she said angrily. “Go into the
store. He mustn’t think that we want him so badly!”</p>

<p>Laughing and crying simultaneously, Mary-Lou
went staggering into the store.</p>

<p>Loseis remained on the bench watching, with her
hands in her lap. The tears were called in; and she
furtively wiped away their traces. Conacher had his
two Beaver Indians with him. These lingered to
fraternize with the Slavis, while the white man came
striding across the natural meadow to the foot of the
rise. He was bare-headed as usual. A newcomer in
the country, the fame of his curly, yellow pate had
already spread far and wide. Alongside the Slavis
he loomed like a young giant. Loseis had seen him
take a Slavi man by the collar in each hand, and lift
them clear of the ground. To the waiting girl he was
like a god come in answer to her prayer.</p>

<p>She was very quiet when he reached her, her smile
tremulous. The change in her from the arrogant
little Princess who had used him so despitefully on his
first visit was so striking, that at first Conacher could
only stand and stare. They never thought to greet
each other. Finally Conacher exhibited the little black
streamer, limp from being clutched in his warm hand.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” he asked simply.</p>

<p>“My father is dead,” said Loseis. “Four days
ago.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Heaven!” cried Conacher. “And you all
alone here! What did you do?”</p>

<p>“I buried him,” said Loseis, spreading out her
hands.</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>Yourself!</span>”</p>

<p>“There was no other to do it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my God!”</p>

<p>Mary-Lou had crept out of the store again. “They
kill Jimmy Moosenose,” she said, nodding in the
direction of the Slavis. “And break into the store.”</p>

<p>“I put them out again,” said Loseis, quickly and
proudly.</p>

<p>“Oh, God! what awful things have been happening
here!” cried Conacher aghast.</p>

<p>His sympathy caused Loseis to tremble dangerously
again. “Oh, it will be all right now,” she said swiftly.
“One white man is enough to put fear into the heart
of these dogs.”</p>

<p>Conacher looked at that brave and piteous figure,
and was caught up in a very hurricane of the emotions.
He was mad to enfold her in his arms; to comfort
the child, to love the woman, but a feeling of chivalry
restrained him. It appeared unseemly to intrude his
love in the moment of her grief; he turned away abruptly,
searching distractedly in his mind for some
expedient to tide him over the dangerous moment.</p>

<p>“I must go fetch my fellows before they are contaminated
by the Slavis,” he said in a strangled voice,
and strode away down the slope again.</p>

<p>“Ah, he does not love me,” murmured Loseis with
extreme sadness.</p>

<p>“You are wrong,” said Mary-Lou. “It was speaking
in his eyes.”</p>

<p>“No! No! No!” said Loseis violently. Nevertheless
she was secretly comforted.</p>

<p>She went bustling into the store. “Come! we will
close up the store now, and go to our own house.
Conacher will be hungry. We must cook a big meal.
There is still some canned apples and canned butter
in the store. Ahchoogah brought in a moose to-day.
I will take a haunch of it for Conacher. I will take
the biggest fish for Conacher, too. Be quick! Be
quick! I will go down and get the other Marys to
help you.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>Later, Loseis and Conacher were sitting at the door
of the Women’s House, while the appetizing odors
came stealing out. A heavy constraint was upon
them; they could not meet each other’s eyes. The
man, looking down, marveled at the delicacy of
Loseis’ shapely hands, lying loosely in her lap. What
a rare, fine creature to find in these rude surroundings!
Her beauty and her proud manner intimidated
him. Who was he to aspire so high? The girl wondered
sadly why the man did not speak. He had only
to speak!</p>

<p>When he did speak it was not in the tone that she
longed to hear. “What are you going to do?” he
asked, matter-of-fact.</p>

<p>To Loseis the solution was simplicity itself. Conacher
was to stay there, and everything go on as before.
But it was not seemly for her to propose this. She
shrugged. “I don’t know,” she said.</p>

<p>“But you must have thought something about what
you would do,” he said surprised. “You can’t stay
here.”</p>

<p>Loseis’ heart sunk. She said nothing.</p>

<p>“Fort Good Hope cannot be but a hundred miles or
so across the height of land,” he went on.</p>

<p>“A hundred and fifty,” said Loseis.</p>

<p>“I have heard there’s a white woman at Fort Good
Hope,” said Conacher. “She’s the parson’s sister.”</p>

<p>“What do I want with the parson’s sister?” demanded
Loseis with a spice of resentment.</p>

<p>Conacher looked at her helplessly.</p>

<p>I would go to Fort Good Hope to the parson with
Conacher if he asked me, thought Loseis, and a deep
blush overspread her neck and face. She turned away
her head to hide it.</p>

<p>“You can’t stay here,” he said.</p>

<p>“I am not going to give up my father’s Post, and
allow the Slavis to strip the store,” said Loseis with
spirit. “Besides, the whole season’s catch of fur is
stored in the warehouse, waiting to be shipped outside.
It is worth many thousands of dollars.”</p>

<p>“How is it sent out?” asked Conacher.</p>

<p>“Every Spring when the grass is grown sufficiently
to graze the horses, it is sent overland by pack-horse
to a warehouse that my father has on the prairie near
the crossing of the big river. That is three hundred
miles. Jimmy Moosenose was always sent with the
horses and men. Seventy horses and fifteen men beside
the cook. In that warehouse they find the grub
for next year and the store goods which are put
there by John Gruber, my father’s outside man. They
bring the grub back, and leave the fur in the warehouse,
and John Gruber gets it afterwards. My
father never allowed the Slavis to meet the Crees
in John Gruber’s outfit. It is time for them to start
now. John Gruber will be waiting many days at the
Crossing.”</p>

<p>“But you’ve no one to send now,” said Conacher.</p>

<p>“Then I must go myself,” said Loseis.</p>

<p>“My God! not alone with a gang of redskins!”
cried Conacher.</p>

<p>“They would not dare harm me,” said Loseis
proudly.</p>

<p>“Maybe not,” cried Conacher violently. “But just
the same I couldn’t stand for that!”</p>

<p>Loseis’ sad heart looked up a little. He did care
a little what became of her.</p>

<p>And then he spoiled it by adding: “No white man
could!”</p>

<p>“We must find somebody to go with you,” he presently
went on; “and then you can continue on outside
with your father’s agent.”</p>

<p>“There is all the grub and store goods waiting to
come in,” objected Loseis.</p>

<p>“That will have to be sold,” said Conacher. “The
Company will buy it.”</p>

<p>“There are all my father’s horses across the river,”
said Loseis; “many thousands of head. During the
summer hay must be cut for them around the shores
of our lake; or next winter they will starve.”</p>

<p>“But my dear girl,” said Conacher, “you cannot
go on doing business here now that he is gone!”</p>

<p>“Why not?” demanded Loseis.</p>

<p>“Why .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. why .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” stammered Conacher. “A
woman trader! Why such a thing was never heard of!”</p>

<p>“Well, it will be heard of now,” said Loseis.</p>

<p>Conacher ascribed this to mere bravado. What a
spirited little thing she was! Like a plucky boy; but
with all the sweetness of a woman. “We must send
to Fort Good Hope for help,” he said.</p>

<p>“Do not speak to me again of Fort Good Hope!”
said Loseis. “Gault, the trader there, was my
father’s enemy.”</p>

<p>Conacher knew nothing of the feuds of the country.
“Yes, yes,” he said soothingly; “but a tragedy like
this wipes out old scores. Gault would not take
advantage of your situation.”</p>

<p>“You are an outsider,” she said. “You do not
know Gault.”</p>

<p>“No man would!” insisted Conacher.</p>

<p>“I will not hand over my father’s Post to Gault!”
cried Loseis. “That would bring my father out of his
grave!”</p>

<p>“Not hand it over to him,” protested Conacher.
“But just let him advise you. He is the only one
that can tell you what is best to do; who can arrange
things. There is no other white man within hundreds
of miles.”</p>

<p>Then it had to come out. “I already know what
to do,” said Loseis, very low. “If you would help
me, we could do it all together.”</p>

<p>Conacher groaned, and clutched his head. “Oh,
God! you don’t understand!” he cried. “And what
must you be thinking of me! What a chance to be
offered to a man, and I can’t take it!” He tried
desperately to explain to her. “You see, I am not
free like the men of this country. I am a government
employee, tied hand and foot to my work. My
whole Summer’s work has been laid out for me. And
my little piece is only a part of a great survey of
this whole country. I am appointed to join with another
party at Great Slave Lake on a certain date,
and we in turn must proceed up the Liard River to
another rendezvous on the Yukon. If I fail, the
whole fails. Don’t you understand?”</p>

<p>She did not wholly understand. “I heard you tell
it,” she said a little sullenly.</p>

<p>Conacher jumped up, and paced the grass in an
agony of indecision. He was teetering on the brink.
If Loseis had raised her eyes to his face, he would
have fallen at her feet, and allowed the government
to go to the devil. But she kept her eyes sullenly
down. And then before either spoke again, with a
smart thudding of hoofs and creaking of saddle
leathers, a well-turned out company of six men and
several spare horses came down the trail behind the
Post, and trotted out into the little plaza.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>Gault had caught sight of Conacher’s yellow head
as soon as he came over the brow of the hill. He
reined up sharply, his face going pinched and ugly.
“A white man here!” he said furiously to Moale.
“Who the devil can he be?”</p>

<p>Moale drew up at his side. “That will be
Conacher,” he said in his unconcerned way. “I have
heard talk of his yellow head.”</p>

<p>“A <span class='it'>young</span> man!” said Gault; and cursed him thickly
and fervently.</p>

<p>“He’s on a government survey down to Great Slave
Lake and beyond,” said Moale indifferently. “He
won’t be able to interfere with us.”</p>

<p>But Gault rode down the hill with a black heart.
The young man had got in his innings first; and now
fifty-three must stand comparison with twenty-three,
and the dyed black head be measured against the
famous golden one.</p>

<p>By the time he rode around the buildings of the
Post his face was perfectly composed and solicitous, of
course. He sat his horse with conscious grace. Flinging
himself off, he tossed the reins to one of the
Crees, and came quickly to Loseis.</p>

<p>“Miss Blackburn,” he said, “the moment I heard
of your terrible loss I jumped on my horse to come
to you. I cannot express to you how shocked and
grieved I am. Your father and I were not good
friends, but that is all past now. Believe me, I am
most completely at your service.”</p>

<p>The watching Conacher considered that this was
very handsomely said. How much better than he
could do it! he thought with a sigh. He had no
reason to share in Loseis’ suspicions of Gault. A load
was lifted from the young man’s heart. Gault’s fine
outfit inspired confidence. Loseis would be all right
now, and he could go on about his work. But before
he left he would ask her to wait for him. The idea
that this old man might prove to be a rival, never
entered Conacher’s honest heart.</p>

<p>Loseis received Gault with a manner no less finished
and proud than his own. “You are welcome,” she
said gravely. “My father’s house”—she indicated
the building opposite—“is at your disposal. If you
wish to put up your horses the stable is behind it.
Or you can turn them out anywhere. Dinner here in
half an hour.”</p>

<p>Gault bowing, expressed his thanks. He then
turned inquiringly towards Conacher.</p>

<p>That young man said: “I am Paul Conacher of
the geological survey.”</p>

<p>Gault thrust out his hand with the appearance of
the greatest cordiality. “I am delighted to meet you,”
he said. “It is a great satisfaction to find that Miss
Blackburn is not alone here.” He gave Conacher a
meaning glance that suggested as between man and
man it would be well for them to discuss the situation
together.</p>

<p>This was quite in line with Conacher’s ideas, and
the two walked off together towards the house opposite.
Loseis watched them go under stormy brows.
She saw Gault place his hand affectionately on the
young man’s shoulder, and her lip curled.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span><h1>CHAPTER VI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE DINNER PARTY</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>G</span>ault</span> and Conacher returned to the Women’s
House for dinner. Gault had changed to a
well-cut black suit with linen of the finest quality, and
a little discreet but handsome jewelry. Poor Conacher,
having no change, showed up at a disadvantage beside
him. When they beheld Loseis both men caught
their breath in astonishment. She was wearing one
of the “outside” dresses which her father had been
accustomed to import that he might have the pleasure
of seeing her in them. This one was of black
velvet cunningly and simply draped, and showing no
touch of color. Around her neck hung a string of
pearls that made Gault open his eyes; not the one
with the gold nuggets; but a long plain string of beautifully
matched stones. The innocent Conacher had
no notion but that it was a string of pearl beads such
as his sisters wore.</p>

<p>The table was laid for four in Loseis’ own room.
She seated Moale facing her; Conacher at her right;
Gault at her left. The trader who was sensitive to
these little things, bit his lip at this arrangement, but
was obliged to put up with it. Conacher never noticed
that he had been given the seat of honor. There was
fine china and silver on the table; and the food was
wonderful, including delicacies which Gault himself
could not command at Fort Good Hope, such as currant
jelly; the joint of moose meat cunningly larded
with bacon, and served with cranberry sauce; an apple
pie. The three comely Marys in black dresses and
snowy aprons moved noiselessly about the table, while
Mary-Lou oversaw all in the kitchen.</p>

<p>To Conacher, after weeks on the trail, it was like
a taste of Heaven; and Gault was obliged to confess
to himself that the establishment while rude, nevertheless
had a better style than his own. Loseis with
her hair done up on top of her head looked like a
Princess indeed, and the trader gloated at the thought
of seeing her enthroned at <span class='it'>his</span> table. He pictured a
glorious future for Fort Good Hope. The thought
of Conacher gave him little concern now. He had put
down the young man to his own satisfaction as a fool.</p>

<p>The trader dominated the table. The lamplight
was favorable to him, and he knew it. None would
have thought of terming him an old man. His manner
was perfection. Open-browed, courteous, half-apologetic,
he kept them entertained with stories of
the country; and both of the young people were to a
certain extent fascinated by his charm. During the
meal business was not to be touched upon.</p>

<p>“Ah! what a privilege it is to have a lady at the
table!” said Gault wrinkling up his eyes, and showing
his big white teeth.</p>

<p>(Rather like the wolf in the fairy-tale; thought
Loseis; but I suppose some would call him a fine-looking
man.)</p>

<p>“Hear! Hear!” said Conacher. The young man
felt like a hobbledehoy alongside the elegant Gault;
but he harbored no malice. Poor Conacher’s heart
was oppressed by the sight of Loseis in her bravery.
Could this be the rude little spitfire that he had dared
to laugh at upon their first meeting?</p>

<p>“That is what we miss in the North,” Gault went
on; “the civilizing touch of lovely woman! It is
terrible the way men go to seed in this country. It
is a fact that when a man’s manners go, his morals
are bound to go too. Ah! my dear Miss Blackburn,
if we had more like you to grace our lonely posts we’d
all be better men!”</p>

<p>(Why haven’t I the face to say such things? thought
Conacher.)</p>

<p>Loseis smiled a little wanly. She was secretly confused
by the trader’s glibness. She had never known
a man like this.</p>

<p>Later they sat down in front of the small fire that
had been lighted to drive away the evening chill;
Loseis in her hammock-chair, the men on either hand
sitting stiffly in the straight-up-and-down chairs that
Blackburn had carved. What remained on the table
was silently whisked into the kitchen.</p>

<p>“You may smoke if you wish,” said Loseis.</p>

<p>Gault produced, wonder of wonders! a full cigar
case, and offered it to the younger man. The fragrance
of the genuine Havana spread around.</p>

<p>“Well!” said Conacher; “I never expected to get
anything like this north of Fifty-eight.”</p>

<p>“Oh, with my improved transport,” said Gault
carelessly, “I can have in pretty much anything I
want.”</p>

<p>It now became necessary to speak of business.
Gault inquired if the season’s fur had been sent out.</p>

<p>“No,” said Loseis.</p>

<p>The trader might almost be said to have purred
upon hearing that. Indeed, fearing himself that he
might be betraying too much complacency about the
mouth, he rubbed his upper lip, and gave a little
cough. “I will charge myself with that,” he said
comfortably. “Make your mind quite easy.”</p>

<p>Loseis looked unhappy, but said nothing.</p>

<p>“Of course,” Gault went on with the air of one
who must be fair at whatever cost to himself, “being
your father’s competitor, his rival as you might say,
it is not proper that I should be your sole advisor.”</p>

<p>Loseis looked at him in surprise. Dared he to
speak of that? Her confusion increased. This man
was too much for her.</p>

<p>“I am mighty glad that Conacher is here,” said
Gault.</p>

<p>“But I must return down the river to-night,” said
Conacher. “I am already many days behind my
schedule.”</p>

<p>Loseis’ eyes were close-hid now. “To-night?” she
echoed softly. “But you paddled all last night to get
here.”</p>

<p>Conacher affected to laugh, while his hungry eyes
sought her averted face. Loseis could have read there
that he didn’t want to go; but she wouldn’t look.
“Oh, going downstream’s a cinch,” said Conacher.
“Two of us can sleep at a time in the dug-out, while
the third man keeps her in the middle of the current.”</p>

<p>Loseis was silent.</p>

<p>“To-night!” said Gault. “Ah, that’s too bad! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
However, I can take my measures before you go .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Does your father employ a man of business, a lawyer,
outside?” he asked Loseis.</p>

<p>“None that I know of,” she said, “except John
Gruber.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Gruber,” said Gault in his purring voice
(Moale at the other end of the row, listened to all
this with a face like a sardonic mask), “an excellent
fellow, too. But too ignorant a man to serve you in
this crisis.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am sure your father must have had
wide interests outside of the fur business,” he said
insinuatingly.</p>

<p>“If he had, I know nothing about it,” said Loseis.
“He got business letters every year when the outfit
came in, but he did not show them to me. I know
nothing of business.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said Gault soothingly. “Have you
looked for those letters since his death?” he asked,
betraying more eagerness than was perhaps in the
best of taste.</p>

<p>“No,” said Loseis, shortly.</p>

<p>Gault was pulled up short. “Hm!” he said, stroking
his chin. “Hm! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” Finally he got a fresh
start. “Well, if Blackburn employed an attorney outside,
Gruber will know his name. Gruber carried all
his letters out, and brought the answers back. I will
write to Gruber. And if Blackburn has no lawyer
already, I will send for the best one obtainable, and
will arrange special means of transport for him. We’ll
have him here in five or six weeks at the outside.
Lastly I will send for a sergeant and detail of the
police, so that the murder of Jimmy Moosenose can
be investigated. Until they come, in order that the
Slavis may not take fright, we will allow them to
suppose that the murder has been forgotten.”</p>

<p>Conacher nodded in agreement with this; Loseis
felt that she was being crowded to one side.</p>

<p>“I’ll start my letters off to Fort Good Hope at
sun-up,” Gault went on. “Unfortunately my steamboat
has gone up to the head of navigation, and won’t
be back for a month; but by the time the messenger
reaches the post, my launch will have returned from
carrying Mr. Ogilvie down to the Chutes. The launch
can make the Crossing in a week. Gruber will be
waiting there.”</p>

<p>It all sounded so businesslike and proper, Loseis
could take no exception to it. The smooth voice, arranging
everything, afflicted her with a sort of despair.</p>

<p>After some desultory talk, Gault arose, saying:
“With your permission I will go and write my letters
now, so that Conacher may see them before he goes.”</p>

<p>Loseis bowed in acquiescence. She thought: I can
talk to Conacher while he is away. But Gault looked
sharply from one to another, and added in his polite
way: “I’d be glad of your help in composing them,
Conacher.” Loseis’ heart sunk. The two went out
together arm in arm. Moale followed his master as
a matter of course.</p>

<p>Loseis was left staring into the fire. Mary-Lou
came to the door and looked at her full of loving
solicitude; but Loseis made believe not to know that
she was there. The simple Mary-Lou could be of no
help to her in this situation. Loseis, whose nature
it was to act instantaneously without thinking, was all
at sea on this flood of words. Everything was mixed
up in her mind. Maybe Gault is a true man, she
thought; maybe he means what he says. Conacher is
satisfied. And if he is lying what can I do anyhow?
I know nothing.</p>

<p>In due course they returned (without Moale) and
the letters were laid before Loseis. It appeared that
Gault packed a little typewriter in his outfit, and
Loseis, though she looked at the letters indifferently,
secretly marveled at the neat clear printing. How
could one contend against a man like this! She
scarcely read the letters. The lengthy sentences
merely dizzied her.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that they were admirably
expressed letters. There is no need of reproducing
them here, since Gault had not the slightest intention
of letting them reach their destinations. They were
to be conveniently lost en route.</p>

<p>“I am satisfied if Conacher is,” said Loseis.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gault has thought of everything,” said
Conacher.</p>

<p>Soon Conacher said, affecting to make light of his
heavy heart: “Well, I’ve sent my men down to launch
the dug-out. I must be getting aboard.”</p>

<p>Gault said quickly in his hearty way: “I’ll go down
and see you off.”</p>

<p>Conacher looked wistfully at Loseis, and hesitated.</p>

<p>Loseis rebelled at last. She did not feel able to
dispute Gault in matters of business, but if he dared
to interfere with her own private concerns, let him
look out! She stood up very quickly, and her chin
went up. “First I want to take Conacher to the store,
and give him some grub to take,” she said coolly.
“You wait here, Mr. Gault.” Her eyes sought his
unafraid, and the trader’s eyes trailed away.</p>

<p>“Why of course!” he said in his hearty way. But
his affable smile had a sickly look now. As they went
through the door he shot a baleful glance after them.
That was a black half hour for him, obliged to sit
there, grinding his big teeth and picturing the two
young creatures together in the dark. Just when
everything had seemed to be going his way, too!</p>

<p>Outside, the black sky was crowded with stars big
and little, all focused on that pair of mortal lovers.
The earth was so still one seemed to hear the whisper
of starlight. Loseis drew a great breath of relief.
Why that load was suddenly lifted from her breast
she could not have told. She involuntarily slipped
her hand under Conacher’s arm, and he pressed it
hard against his ribs. They walked, pressing close
together, the blond head brooding low over the black
one. There was no confession of love. They were
still afraid of that word. And anyhow this was confession
enough. With happiness their hearts became
as breathlessly still as the night.</p>

<p>“Let’s not go to the store,” whispered Conacher.
“I don’t need any grub.”</p>

<p>“I just said that,” whispered Loseis. “I wanted to
be with you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you dear! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you dear! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you dear!”
he murmured tremulously.</p>

<p>Loseis pressed his arm. “Let’s go down on the
flat,” she whispered. “He might come to the door
to watch us.”</p>

<p>They went down the grassy slope. For a long
time they did not speak. They walked at a snail’s
pace, arms linked, hands clasped, and heads leaning
together. At last a little whimpering sound was heard
from Loseis. That brave heart owned its weakness
at last.</p>

<p>“Oh, Paul!” she faltered. “Oh Paul, <span class='it'>must</span> you
go?”</p>

<p>“I must! I must!” he cried in pain. “But I will
arrange things just as quick as I can, and come back.”</p>

<p>“It will be so long!” she said sadly.</p>

<p>“But at least you are safe now.”</p>

<p>“Oh, safe .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. maybe!”</p>

<p>“If you are afraid, come with me. I will take care
of you.”</p>

<p>“No,” she said quickly. “That would not be acting
right towards my father.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am not afraid of
any danger. But .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I cannot see what is before
me! I do not like that man!”</p>

<p>“He seems to be on the square,” said Conacher
anxiously. “He has provided for everything better
than I could.”</p>

<p>“It is so terrible for me to have to be with somebody
I do not like,” said Loseis.</p>

<p>“You have your own house,” said Conacher. “And
your girls. You need only talk to him about business
matters.”</p>

<p>“He is so ugly!” said Loseis.</p>

<p>“You silly girl!” said Conacher fondly. “Gault’s
considered a very fine-looking man!”</p>

<p>“Not to me! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You are beautiful, my Paul. In
the dark I can see your beauty!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Loseis! you must not say such things!” he
said, genuinely distressed. “It is not fitting from you
to me!”</p>

<p>“Why?” she asked wilfully.</p>

<p>“Because .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. because .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. by comparison with
you I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, Loseis, I ought to be kneeling at your
feet!”</p>

<p>“What good would you be to my feet?” she asked,
nestling against him. “I like it better this way.”</p>

<p>Conacher laughed suddenly and delightedly in his
throat.</p>

<p>“Well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?” said Loseis, leaving her interrogation
in the air.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, you make me <span class='it'>say</span> it!” she cried vexatiously.
“Do you think I am beautiful?”</p>

<p>The question rendered him nearly speechless. He
pressed her hand hard against his cheek. “Oh,
Loseis!” he stammered. “I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
can’t tell you. I’m just a blundering fool when it
comes to expressing my feelings. Why, you have
made a new world for me. When I think of your face
it drives me out of my senses. I can’t think of the
words for it!”</p>

<p>She pillowed her cheek happily in the hollow inside
his shoulder. “Then you must find words!” she said.
“You must never stop telling me. My ears are greedy
to hear it. Of all the world, I only care to be beautiful
for you!”</p>

<p>In sight of the darkly flowing river they came to a
stop. They could hear the murmuring voices of the
two Beaver Indians at the water’s edge. They drew
apart. For a long while they stood there not touching
each other in dumb unhappiness and constraint.
They were both new at this lovemaking business.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Conacher at last, like a schoolboy
trying to carry it off flippantly, “I must make a
break .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she cried, hurt to the quick. “Is that all
you care?”</p>

<p>He dropped his absurd pretense. “It is like death
to leave you now,” he murmured, brokenly.</p>

<p>“Well, good-by,” she said suddenly in an unnaturally
high-pitched voice. And turned as if to run
forthwith.</p>

<p>He caught hold of her. “No! No!” he cried.
“Not like this!”</p>

<p>She struggled in his arms. “Let me go! Let
me go!” she whispered in a desperate voice. “I can’t
stand these good-bys. I like a thing ended quickly.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Let me go!”</p>

<p>Holding her within one arm he tried to turn up her
face to his. “Loseis .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dearest .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. before I go,”
he whispered imploringly. “<span class='it'>Please</span>, Loseis.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. To
remember all those lonely nights .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>She resisted with all her strength. “No! No!
No! No! Not yet! If you kiss me I shall never
be able to let you go! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ah, let me go while I
want to go!”</p>

<p>That naïve cry touched his heart. He released
her. The instant she was released she lost all her
desire to run. She stood there in front of him, very
still.</p>

<p>“You had better go,” he said shakily.</p>

<p>“Put your hands behind your back!” she whispered
breathlessly. “Stoop down a little.”</p>

<p>He obeyed.</p>

<p>Like lightning her arms went around his neck, and
her lips were pressed hard against his. Then like a
shadow she was gone. Through the dark her caressing
whisper came back to him.</p>

<p>“Come back soon, dear!”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>When Loseis got back to the Women’s House, Gault
was sitting there by the fire, smoking a fresh cigar.
He sprang up with a pleasant, fatherly sort of smile.
His eyes dwelt lightly on Loseis’s face, but she had
an impression just the same, that they were boring
into her. Well, let them bore! At the business of
hiding her heart she was fully his match. She showed
him a smooth, untroubled face.</p>

<p>“Has he gone?” asked Gault.</p>

<p>“I expect so,” said Loseis. “I did not go down
the hill with him.”</p>

<p>Gault rubbed his lip. He didn’t know whether or
not to believe her.</p>

<p>He felt his way carefully. “Conacher seems like
a fine young fellow,” he remarked. “Have you known
him long?”</p>

<p>Loseis remained standing by the fire. “Oh, he
stopped here for three days,” she said coolly. “But
I scarcely saw him then.”</p>

<p>“How did he learn so soon of your father’s death?”</p>

<p>“I never thought to ask him,” said Loseis with a
clear brow. “By moccasin telegraph, I suppose. The
Slavis are continually traveling up and down the river.”</p>

<p>“It is too bad that he is in the government employ,”
said Gault.</p>

<p>Loseis had no intention of discussing the man she
loved with another man. She remained silent. She
had a good capacity for holding her tongue. It was
her only defense against Gault’s smooth talk; and
it was a better defense than she realized.</p>

<p>Gault was obliged to go on and answer the question
without its having been asked. “They never come
to anything,” he said. “They are no more than
clerks all their lives.”</p>

<p>“So I have heard,” said Loseis indifferently.</p>

<p>Gault was deceived by her coolness. He argued
that she was too young to be able to hide her feelings
so consummately. She did not care for the young
geologist. Their meetings had been too few and
brief for any serious damage to be worked. He began
to feel better.</p>

<p>“How did you learn of my father’s death?” asked
Loseis unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Gault determined to tell the truth, since it must
become known anyway. “The Indian Etzooah brought
me the news. Did you not send him?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Loseis.</p>

<p>“Well!” said Gault with an air of astonishment.
“I suppose he must have started off blindly on his own
account.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know he could speak English,” said
Loseis.</p>

<p>“He can’t. Only Cree.”</p>

<p>“Nobody here knew that he could speak Cree,
either,” said Loseis.</p>

<p>Gault allowed the subject to drop. “While you
were away I have been sitting here thinking over your
affairs,” he said, enveloping Loseis with his smile.</p>

<p>Oh, Heaven! she thought; is he going to start talking
again? How can I endure it without Conacher
here to keep me in countenance! In desperation she
feigned to hide a yawn behind her hand.</p>

<p>Gault had no recourse but to take the hint. “You
are worn out!” he said solicitously. “And no wonder.
I will retire now. And to-morrow we can talk.”</p>

<p>Loseis’ heart sunk. To-morrow!—and all the succeeding
to-morrows! Should she never be able to
escape his talk! “You are very kind,” she murmured
politely.</p>

<p>“Good-night,” said Gault, offering her his hand.</p>

<p>Loseis either had to give him hers, or come to an
open quarrel. With an inward shiver of repulsion,
she laid her hand within his, keeping her eyes close
hid. “Good-night,” she murmured.</p>

<p>Good God! how beautiful she is! thought Gault;
with her mixture of haughty pride and shyness (for
so he took it). I’d take her if she didn’t have a
cent! A genuine desire was mingled with the calculation
in his eyes; he bared his teeth in what he intended
to be an ardent smile. In his youth Gault
had been famous for his big white teeth, and he did
not realize that their luster was somewhat diminished.
For a moment he clung to the cool, limp hand.</p>

<p>“My dear, dear girl!” he murmured. “If you only
knew how my heart goes out to you in this hour of
affliction. My only desire is to serve you!”</p>

<p>Loseis gritted her teeth in a torment of repulsion.
Grinning at her in that disgusting way, while his hard
eyes sought to pry into her heart? She could <span class='it'>feel</span>
his grin, though she kept her eyes down. Her hand
trembled with the desire to snatch itself away, and
smack his leering old face. But above all she was determined
that Blackburn’s daughter should not be revealed
to this fine gentleman as a savage uncultured
girl, and she commanded her repulsion.</p>

<p>“Good-night .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. good-night,” repeated Gault with
a touch of archness, that looked to the future. He
hastened out with a debonair swing. Loseis’ fiery
eyes bored holes in his back.</p>

<p>Crossing the grass, Gault exulted within himself.
“A half-formed child,” he thought; “an experienced
man can make whatever he chooses of her! And by
God, what natural elegance! what pride! what beauty!
I am in luck!”</p>

<p>While within the room he had just left, Loseis
scowled at her offending hand, and rubbed it violently
on her skirt.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span><h1>CHAPTER VII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE CLOVEN HOOF</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>N</span>ext</span> morning before Loseis had breakfasted,
Gault was back at the Women’s House, knocking
deprecatingly at the door.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to disturb you so early,” he said, “but I
forgot something last night; and I’m holding my messenger
now until I can get it from you.”</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked Loseis.</p>

<p>“May I come in?” he said smiling.</p>

<p>Loseis led the way into her room.</p>

<p>Gault had several sheets of paper in his hand. “If,
as I suspect,” he began in the smooth voice which so
exasperated Loseis without her knowing why, “Blackburn
has sums of money lying in the bank outside, that
belongs to you, of course; but you could not draw
against it unless the bank was already in possession of
your signature. Therefore, in order to save time, I
propose to send out several specimens of your signature
now. I will put them in the hands of your lawyer,
who will in turn pass them on to the bank.”</p>

<p>This sounded all right to Loseis, who proceeded to
write her name on each of the four blank sheets that
Gault passed her. Loseis had had small occasion
to practice the art of handwriting, and it was but
slowly that she formed the great round letters of her
official name.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'><span class='it'>Laurentia Blackburn</span></p>

<p>“Laurentia!” murmured Gault in a fond voice.
“What an odd name.”</p>

<p>“I believe I was named after a chain of mountains,”
said Loseis dryly.</p>

<p>“But how dignified and melodious!” he said.
“Laurentia .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Laurentia .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. !”</p>

<p>She shot an irritated glance at him through her
lashes. Had the man nothing better to do than to
stand there mouthing her name in that ridiculous fashion!
Loseis privately detested her name. Jane
would have been more to her fancy.</p>

<p>Gault gathered up the sheets, and made as if to
go. At the door he paused: “I say,” he said, like
one speaking to a child, “isn’t there something at Fort
Good Hope that you would like my messenger to bring
back to you? I have a regular ‘outside’ store at
Good Hope, you know.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, thank you,” said Loseis quickly. “Nothing
at all!”</p>

<p>“Just the same,” said Gault with that arch smile of
his, “I will see if we cannot find something that will
please you!”</p>

<p>As he went through the door Loseis involuntarily
flung up her arms crying: “Oh, give me air! Give
me air!”</p>

<p>Mary-Lou came running in to see what was the
matter.</p>

<p>Loseis kicked a fur rug violently to one side, and
banged open the little window. “Oh, that man is like
a bearskin tied over one’s head; like a feather bed
upon one!” she cried. Standing back from the window
she angrily apostrophized the receding figure of Gault.
“Yes, you! you! If I have to see you every day I shall
suffocate!” Turning around and beholding the amazed
figure of Mary-Lou, Loseis suddenly embraced her, and
dropping her head on her shoulder, burst into tears.</p>

<p>“But what is the matter?” gasped Mary-Lou.</p>

<p>“I don’t know!” wailed Loseis. “I must be crazy!
He speaks fair and honest; he is always polite and
kind .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but I <span class='it'>can’t stand</span> the man!”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>Before the morning was out Gault was seen returning.
Loseis, who had persuaded herself that she was
a fool, schooled herself to receive him politely. He
was accompanied this time by one of his Crees, who
was carrying a neat leather-covered box by its handle.
Gault never performed such menial tasks for himself.
There was enough of the child in Loseis to be rendered
intensely curious by the sight of that box.</p>

<p>The trader dismissed his servant at the door, and
brought the box in himself. Upon being laid on the
table and opened, a most fascinating and complicated
little machine was revealed, all shining with nickel-plate
and black lacquer. Loseis had not the remotest
idea of what it was for.</p>

<p>“This is the typewriter; the writing-machine,” explained
the trader. “I have another one at the Post
which I have sent for. In the meantime I want to
present this to you. I thought it might amuse you to
practice on it; and it will certainly save you time.
Now that you are a business woman, you will have
many letters to write.”</p>

<p>Loseis’ heart was touched by this seeming act of
kindness. She felt remorseful. “That is very good
of you,” she said, blushing. “It is true, I am a miserable
writer. But I shall never be able to learn this.”</p>

<p>“On the contrary,” said Gault. “It is very simple.
Sit down at the table and I will show you now.”</p>

<p>Loseis obeyed; and Gault drew up another chair
close beside her. He explained to her how to put the
paper in; how to shift the carriage back and forth;
how to start a new line. For the rest all you had
to do was to strike the proper letters. In ten minutes
Loseis had mastered the idea of the thing. She was
fascinated with this new toy (she had possessed so
few toys in her life) but was made horribly uncomfortable
by the enforced proximity of Gault’s head to
her own. He was chewing some sort of medicated
candy that gave his breath a strong, pungent odor.
Loseis hated strong smells of every kind.</p>

<p>“Now let me try it all by myself,” she said.</p>

<p>“Go ahead! Go ahead!” he said, but did not withdraw
himself at all. When he saw her at a loss, he
would grab hold of her finger and guide it to the
right key. Loseis shivered internally.</p>

<p>Finally her discomfort became more than she could
bear. “I cannot do a thing if you hang over me like
that,” she said.</p>

<p>Gault leaned back in his chair with a great laugh.
“So independent!” he said teasingly.</p>

<p>However, he held himself away from her, and
Loseis proceeded with her slow punching of the keys.
How strange and fascinating to see the words stand
up upon the paper! She had never possessed so
marvelous a toy as this. As soon as Gault was out
of the way she would start a letter to Conacher. How
astonished he would be!</p>

<p>In a minute or two Gault’s head was as close as
ever to hers. Loseis tried to ignore the fact, but it
was impossible to do so. She was aware, through a
subtle feminine sense, that he was not paying any attention
to the typewriter now. He was too still. She felt as
if something precious were being drawn from her that
she had no intention of yielding to any man save one.</p>

<p>“I’ll go on with this this afternoon,” she said nervously.
“I have to do something else now.” At the same
time she attempted to slide sideways out of her chair.</p>

<p>Gault caught her hand. “Ah, don’t stop,” he said
a little thickly. “You look like such a cunning little
student, bending over your work. Where did you get
that wonderful black hair of yours .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?”</p>

<p>Loseis was up like a wild thing then, and backing
off to the far end of the room. “How dare you!
How dare you!” she said breathlessly. “Take yourself
out of here, and your machine too! Or I’ll fling
it after you! Did you bring it here only as an excuse
to insult me!”</p>

<p>Gault rose also. “Well!” he cried, laughing heartily.
But there was an ugly look in his eyes.</p>

<p>His laughter immediately brought about a reaction
in Loseis. She realized that she was making far too
much of a trifle. This was not the way for a well-born
girl to act. She told herself that it was only
because she had come to love another man that she
found this one detestable. She lowered her head, and
a hot blush flowed over her cheeks.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” she muttered unwillingly. “I am out
of sorts this morning. I did not mean what I said.”
In the very act of saying this Loseis’ heart accused
her of cowardice. She felt hopelessly confused. Oh,
how difficult it was to be well-bred and ladylike.</p>

<p>“Why, that’s all right!” cried Gault heartily. “It
is perfectly natural at such a time. I’m sorry I displeased
you. I assure you I feel nothing for you, but
the deepest respect and sympathy! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’ll leave you
now. Do amuse yourself with the typewriter.”</p>

<p>As he walked away from the house he murmured
to himself: “A skittish filly! I must proceed more
slowly. Gad! it’s difficult though!” Thus he deceived
himself, as middle-aged gentlemen bent on gallantry
are so apt to do. He felt delightfully ardent.
At the same time though, a nasty little anxiety continued
to plague the back of his mind.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Loseis paced up and down her room,
wondering for the hundredth time within the past
twenty-four hours, what was the matter with her, that
she felt so hopelessly divided. This was a new feeling
for her. However the shining little typewriter <span class='it'>was</span>
fascinating. She presently sat down to compose a
letter to Conacher; and forgot her troubles. Another
little raft carried her letter downstream.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>Every afternoon Loseis opened the store. It was
a point of pride with her to comport herself in all
respects towards the Slavis as if nothing had happened.
She often visited their village, interesting herself
in all their concerns, as she considered fitting in
a prudent mistress towards her childish and feather-brained
servants. They were shy with her, and none
came to trade at the store. Loseis, shrugging, was
content to bide her time. Hunger would tell in the
end. For twenty years now, the Slavis had been accustomed
to the white man’s flour, tea and sugar, and
the present generation could not do without them.</p>

<p>Loseis and Mary-Lou sat on the bench outside the
store. Mary-Lou had been reading aloud, but her
mistress had silenced her, because she wished to think.
Loseis was unpracticed in the exercise of thinking
things over, and she found it both difficult and painful.
This was the question on which she split: was Gault
a scoundrel? All his acts and words seemed to be
above reproach; but Loseis’ heart stubbornly misgave
her. Could she trust her heart? She reflected that
her father had never betrayed any hesitation in calling
Gault a scoundrel; but Loseis had had plenty of
examples of her father’s wrong-headedness. She
adored him, but had no great opinion of his judgment.
It was by his strength and energy that Blackburn had
forged ahead, not by wisdom. And so the weary
round continued. To one of Loseis’ downright nature
it was torture to remain in a state of indecision.</p>

<p>At the door of Blackburn’s House fifty yards distant
from where they sat, the Indian Etzooah was to be
seen ostentatiously cleaning a pair of Gault’s boots. It
suggested itself to Loseis as rather curious that Gault
should choose the ignorant Slavi for a body-servant,
when he had the more civilized Crees. She recollected
that on various occasions during the past few days
she had seen Etzooah hanging about looking self-conscious.
The thought popped into her head that
perhaps Gault had set him as a spy on her movements.
Well, supposing that to be so, here was a chance to
turn the tables on the trader. Through Etzooah she
might be able to learn if Gault had lied to her.</p>

<p>She called to Etzooah in her ordinary manner of
offhand assurance. When he came to her cringing
and grinning in his imbecile fashion (you could read
nothing in that grin of the Slavis) she said coolly:</p>

<p>“I need a man. There are some goods in the store
to be moved.”</p>

<p>Leading him inside, she had him shift some bags of
flour from one place to another. This done, she
presented him with a plug of tobacco, and let him
know that he had done all she required. They returned
outside, and Loseis bade Mary-Lou go on
with the reading.</p>

<p>Etzooah, as Loseis expected, did not leave them,
but, making his face perfectly vacant, squatted down
in the grass at the other side of the door, and proceeded
to shave a pipeful of tobacco from the plug,
careful not to spill a crumb. Loseis allowed Mary-Lou
to read for awhile, then she started slightly as
if a thought had just occurred to her, and motioned
to the girl to stop.</p>

<p>“Etzooah,” she said (speaking in the Slavi tongue
of course) “it comes to me that I have not thanked
you for fetching Gault from Fort Good Hope. That
was well done.”</p>

<p>Etzooah grinned. “Gault is a good man,” he said.</p>

<p>“You speak truth,” said Loseis gravely. “How did
it come that you set off without telling me?”</p>

<p>“Wah!” said Etzooah, “you were attending upon
the body of Blackburn. It was not right for me to
go to you at such a time. I just caught some horses
and went.”</p>

<p>“It was well thought of,” said Loseis. “How did
you make yourself understood to the white men?”</p>

<p>“I speak the Cree,” said Etzooah.</p>

<p>“Wah!” said Loseis politely. “That was not known
to me.”</p>

<p>“My father was a Cree,” said Etzooah. “It is
well known.”</p>

<p>“I had forgotten,” said Loseis.</p>

<p>Without changing a muscle of her face, or raising
her voice at all, Loseis shifted to English. “Etzooah,”
she said, “the Slavis are saying to each other that you
were false to your own people. They are angry because
you brought Gault here.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Do not move
suddenly or you are a dead man. Mahtsonza is hiding
behind the corner of the store with a gun in his
hands waiting to shoot you!”</p>

<p>Etzooah’s copper face changed to a livid ash-color.
Suddenly with a single movement he bounded to his
feet, and inside the door of the store. Loseis stood up
with a scornful laugh.</p>

<p>“Go back to your master,” she said, pointing. “I
only wished to find out if you could speak English.
You are a spy!”</p>

<p>Etzooah slunk away. Still only half convinced that
he had been tricked, he kept glancing fearfully over his
shoulder.</p>

<p>Loseis was filled with a fierce exultation. Now she
<span class='it'>knew</span>! No more indecision. To be sure, when she reflected,
her solitary and desperate situation might well
appall the stoutest heart; but at the moment she was
only aware of the relief of getting rid of that suffocating
sense of futility. Now she would know what to
do! Her father was right about Gault; and her own
heart had not played her false.</p>

<p>She closed the store, and took Mary-Lou back to
their house.</p>

<p>Loseis’ nature knew no half measures. Having
recognized Gault as her enemy, she was prepared to
fight. She did not blink the danger of her position.
She no longer had any illusions about the fate of
those letters which the trader had so impressively despatched
outside. She realized that Gault himself
stood between her and any possible succor, and that
he intended to keep her cut off from her kind until he
should have obtained what he wanted. Well, she
quickly resolved upon a course of action. Her only
hope lay in bringing her wits into play. Gault must
not be allowed to suspect that she saw through his
schemes. Etzooah, she knew, would never dare confess
to his master that he had betrayed himself.
There was a fatuous side to Gault’s character; and
she must play on that. Perhaps through his own folly
she might defeat him in the end.</p>

<p>Suddenly Loseis clapped her hands to her head with
a cry of dismay. She had suddenly recollected that all
her father’s papers were in his desk in the room where
Gault was sleeping, and the desk was not even locked!
While he was alive of course, nobody would have dared
venture into Blackburn’s room uninvited, much less
touch his papers. Loseis beat her fists against her head,
and groaned in bitterness. What an ignorant childish
fool she had been to neglect a thing so important!</p>

<p>She ran to the window to look across at the men’s
house. She could not tell whether Gault was within
or not. On the spur of the moment she sent Mary-Lou
across to invite Gault and Moale to supper with
her. Mary-Lou returned to say that the two men had
ridden up to the lake (ten miles distant) to have a
look at the Slavi village there. Loseis then ventured
across herself.</p>

<p>Etzooah was in the kitchen of the house. He received
her with his customary witless grin, and edged
in front of the door to the inner room as if to keep her
out. Loseis caught her breath in astonishment, and
her eyes fairly blazed on the man.</p>

<p>“Stand aside, dog of a redskin!” she cried. “This
is my father’s house, and Gault is only a guest here at
my pleasure!”</p>

<p>To the terrified Indian it seemed as if the little
figure had grown a foot. He slunk aside, and Loseis
went into her father’s room, closing the door after her.</p>

<p>Upon her first glance at the desk it was apparent to
her that Gault had stolen a march on her; though she
did not immediately understand the significance of
what he had done. The desk was a handsome piece
after the Colonial style made by Blackburn himself.
It had four drawers below, and a flap which lifted
down to form the writing table. The drawers and the
flap alike were fastened shut by strips of papers, caught
down by clots of sealing wax. Going closer Loseis
saw that the wax had been impressed with Gault’s ring.</p>

<p>Loseis smiled bitterly. Her first impulse was to
tear open these flimsy seals; but she held her hand.
No; the damage was already done; if anything had
been abstracted, how was she to know? Better to
keep Gault in ignorance of the fact that she had been
there. She did not believe that Etzooah would tell
him, unless it occurred to Gault to question him. A
Slavi never volunteers any information to a white man.
The upshot was that Loseis turned around, and went
home.</p>

<p>The invitation to supper was repeated later. When
Gault came over it was a changed Loseis who greeted
him. Her uncertainty was gone. Danger stimulated
her; all her faculties were sharpened. She had put on
one of her prettiest dresses; her dark eyes sparkled
with topaz lights; and she gave Gault smile for smile.
The trader was charmed. She is coming ’round, he
thought; I knew she would.</p>

<p>Moale saw deeper. His inscrutable eyes followed
Loseis with a new respect. Moale served his master
very faithfully, but he was like the Slavis in one respect;
he never volunteered any information.</p>

<p>Supper was quite a jolly occasion. Loseis listened
attentively to Gault’s stories; and was prompt with
her applause. The trader visibly expanded; and
Moale’s expression as he watched him became even
more sardonic than usual. During the course of the
meal, Loseis said with an innocent air:</p>

<p>“Mr. Gault, all my father’s papers are in that desk
in your room. Will you go over everything with me
to-morrow, and explain it.”</p>

<p>He wagged a protesting hand in her direction.
“No, no, no,” he said; “nothing must be touched until
the lawyer comes.”</p>

<p>“That cannot be for weeks yet,” said Loseis, “and
in the meantime I am curious to .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>“I have sealed the desk,” said Gault.</p>

<p>“Sealed my father’s desk?” said Loseis, opening
her eyes wide.</p>

<p>“My dear girl, consider my position,” he said. “I
am an interested party in these matters—or at least
I will be so considered; and I have to lean over backwards
in the effort to avoid anything which would look
like taking an unfair advantage. Imagine my feelings
upon retiring that first night, when I found myself
alone in the room with all the private papers of my
late rival in business! I was shocked; shocked. If
the desk had been locked, and the key in your possession
it would have been all right; but upon trying it—for
my own protection, I found that it was open.
Fortunately Moale was in the kitchen. I instantly
called him in, and sealed up the desk in his presence.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you let me know?” asked Loseis.</p>

<p>“It was late. You had retired.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you speak of it next day?”</p>

<p>“I never thought of it. It is customary when a
man dies to seal up his papers until his attorney can
take charge. I did it as a matter of course.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps his papers are not there after all,” said
Loseis.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” said Gault, with a seeming open
look. “I only moved the cover with my thumb for
about a quarter of an inch to find out if it was locked.
I know no more than the man in the moon what the
desk contains.”</p>

<p>Loseis lowered her eyes. What a fool he must
think me! she thought—well, it is just as well that he
should think me a fool.</p>

<p>“Did Blackburn possess a safe?” asked Gault.</p>

<p>“No,” said Loseis. “Nobody ever stole anything
from my father.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could say the same,” said Gault ruefully.
He went on to tell the story of the Scotch half-breed
who had brought a black fox skin to his post to trade,
and had then replaced it with a clumsy imitation, almost
under the trader’s nose. It appeared that he
had worked the trick in turn at every post on the big
river; but was apprehended at Fort McMaster on his
way out. Loseis, smiling at the story, permitted Gault
to suppose that it had caused her to forget the sealed
desk.</p>

<p>After the meal, Gault sent Moale away on a manifestly
trumped-up errand. Loseis was not sorry to
see him go. She was a little afraid of his unchanging,
watchful gaze. He never spoke unless he were addressed.
As for Gault, it was curious that now she
knew he was her enemy, she no longer dreaded to be
left alone with him.</p>

<p>She drew up the hammock-chair to the fire. “You
must take this chair to-night,” she said. “And light
one of your delicious cigars.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There,” she said
presently, “that is just like the happy nights when my
father came to sit with me.”</p>

<p>Gault’s smile became a little bleak. He didn’t
want to be regarded as a father. He stole a look at
Loseis to see if this could be an intentional dig; but
her face expressed only an innocent pleasure in seeing
him comfortable.</p>

<p>She perched herself on one of the straight-backed
chairs beside him, with her heels cocked up on the
rungs. “Have you ever been married, Mr. Gault?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“No,” said the trader, a little uncertain as to what
was coming next.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Loseis.</p>

<p>“Well,” said he, looking noble, “I could not bear
to expose the kind of woman that I wished to marry
to my rude life in the wilderness.”</p>

<p>“How lonely you must have been!” murmured
Loseis.</p>

<p>Gault felt reassured. This was the sort of talk a
man had the right to expect from a white woman. He
settled himself for a comfortable heart to heart talk
by the fire. “Ah, yes,” he said with a far-away look;
“I have had my bitter times! People call me a hard
man; they do not know! They do not know!”</p>

<p>The corners of Loseis’ mouth twitched demurely.
“Tell me all about yourself,” she murmured.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span><h1>CHAPTER VIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>HEAVENLY MUSIC</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>t</span> noon of the fourth day after his setting-out,
Gault’s messenger returned from Fort Good
Hope driving several laden pack-horses before him.
The horses were unpacked at the door of Blackburn’s
House, and the goods carried in. From their windows
opposite, Loseis and the four Marys full of
curiosity, watched and speculated on the contents of
the various packages. The natural consequence of
Blackburn’s having forbidden all traffic across the
height of land was that Fort Good Hope loomed in the
imagination of his people as a sort of fabulous place.
Anything might come from there.</p>

<p>By and by Gault was seen coming across the grass
accompanied by a breed with a canvas duffle bag over
his shoulder.</p>

<p>“More presents for you!” cried Mary-Lou clasping
her hands.</p>

<p>Loseis permitted all the girls to be present while the
bag was unpacked. Gault disregarded them. Thrusting
his arm into the bag, he produced the various articles
with a tender and proprietary smile upon Loseis.
The Princess at such a moment was like any other
young thing; breathless with anticipation, all her difficulties
and dangers forgotten. First came several
packages of novels, and an exclamation of pleasure escaped
her. Novels had been forbidden her; and she
had had no more than tantalizing tastes of their contents
in the installments appearing in the magazines
which drifted to Blackburn’s Post from time to time.
Next came boxes of chocolates and other candies
specially packed in tin. Next bottles of perfumes of
various sorts, and boxes of strongly-scented soaps.
As soon as Gault was out of the way, Loseis distributed
these amongst her hand-maids. Next a box of elegant
writing paper; pink, with gold edges.</p>

<p>“For you to write to me upon when I am gone,”
said Gault with his fond smile.</p>

<p>(May that be soon! thought Loseis.) Aloud she
said: “How pretty!”</p>

<p>The most astonishing present came, as was most
fitting, from the bottom of the bag. From a little
card-board box Gault took a shining nickel cube, having
a sort of cup at one end, covered with glass.
When you pressed a spring in the cube, light most
miraculously appeared behind the glass. Loseis took
it gingerly in her hands, gazing at it with wide and
wondering eyes. The four red girls drew back, a little
afraid.</p>

<p>“Of course you can’t get the full effect of it until
dark,” said Gault.</p>

<p>“This is the electric light of which I have read,”
said Loseis in a hushed voice. “How strange and
beautiful!”</p>

<p>“There’s a box of extra batteries when it gives out,”
said the trader.</p>

<p>Batteries meant nothing to Loseis. The gleaming
torch had laid a spell upon her imagination. She
switched it on and off. How strange, how strange
this little light that she summoned and dismissed with
a touch of her finger, like a fairy servant!</p>

<p>“If you went through the Slavi village some night
with that in your hand it would create a sensation,”
said Gault laughing.</p>

<p>His laughter jarred on Loseis. “No use frightening
them for nothing,” she said. “I might need it some
time.”</p>

<p>In the beginning it would have irked Loseis very
much to receive these presents from Gault, but now she
felt no qualms. He is counting on getting it back many
times over, she thought.</p>

<p>During the course of the afternoon, Loseis and her
girls were astonished to see Gault’s men climbing to
the roof of Blackburn’s House. Alongside the chimney
they affixed a tall pole. When it was up, wires were
strung from it to the top of the flagpole in the middle
of the little plaza. Loseis’ curiosity could no longer
contain itself. She went across to ask what they were
doing.</p>

<p>“Wait until to-night,” said Gault, smiling. “You
are dining with me to-night. Afterwards there is to
be a surprise.”</p>

<p>That dinner was full of new things for Loseis. A
crowning touch was supplied by a potted geranium in
the center of the table, bearing three scarlet blossoms.
Never before had that flower bloomed at Blackburn’s
Post. A cry of admiration broke from Loseis.</p>

<p>“The parson’s sister sent it to you with her compliments,”
said the trader. “She has them blooming all
winter in her parlor.”</p>

<p>Loseis’ heart suddenly went out to this unknown
sister of her own color. “What is she like?” she
asked shyly.</p>

<p>“Oh, just what you’d expect a parson’s sister to be,”
he said indifferently.</p>

<p>The food was strange to Loseis; but for the most
part highly agreeable. First there was a queer, spicy
soup. Mulligatawney, Gault called it, and Loseis
laughed at the ridiculous-sounding word. It must have
come out of a can, she reflected. This was followed
by a great roast of beef which is extraordinarily esteemed
as an article of food up North, simply because
it is so hard to come by. (“A steer was slaughtered
at Fort Good Hope expressly for you,” said Gault to
Loseis with a bow.) With the roast beef were served
potatoes and stewed tomatoes, both novel dishes at
Blackburn’s Post. For dessert came on a plum pudding,
likewise out of a can; and this Loseis considered
the best thing she had ever tasted. There were, besides,
small dishes containing olives which the guest
did not like; and salted almonds which she did.</p>

<p>Pride forbade Loseis to betray any further curiosity
concerning the “surprise” but with every mouthful she
took, she was thrillingly conscious of an oblong box
that rested on a small table at the side of the room,
covered by a cloth. That must be the surprise of
course. It had a most exciting shape.</p>

<p>After the table had been cleared, Gault sought to
tease her, by lighting up his cigar in leisurely fashion,
while he talked of indifferent matters. But he didn’t
get any change out of Loseis, who sat quietly with her
hands in her lap, looking at the fire.</p>

<p>Finally he said: “Wouldn’t you like to know what is
under that cloth?”</p>

<p>“Whenever you are ready,” said Loseis politely.</p>

<p>Gault laughed, and jerked the cloth away. Loseis
beheld a beautiful box of a polished red wood, having
in the front of it several curious black knobs with indicators
and dials above them. The whole apparatus
was suggestive of magic. Gault began to turn the
knobs, and Loseis, holding her breath, prepared herself
for anything to happen; red and green flames perhaps,
with a Jinn springing up in the middle.</p>

<p>When it came, it let her down suddenly from that
awful suspense. It was not startling at all, but sweet.
Music mysteriously filled the room, coming, not from
that box, but from an unknown source. It melted the
heart with its sweetness. It resembled the music of
a violin with which Loseis was familiar, but infinitely
fuller and richer, with strange, deep undertones that
caused delicious shivers to run up the girl’s spine.</p>

<p>“Oh, what is it? What is it?” she murmured.</p>

<p>“Music from Heaven,” said Gault grinning.</p>

<p>For a moment she believed him. Closing her eyes,
she gave herself up to the entrancing sounds. It was
too beautiful, too beautiful to be of this earth. Yet it
was not strange; it seemed like something she had always
been waiting for; it satisfied a longing. It caused
her to think of her father and of her lover. The
thoughts of death and of love became intermingled in
her mind, intolerably sweet and bitter. The tears
swelled under her eyelids.</p>

<p>Then Gault destroyed the spell that he himself had
evoked. “It’s coming through fine, to-night,” he remarked
to Moale. “No interference.”</p>

<p>Loseis dropped down to earth. A recollection came
to her. “It is the radio,” she said quietly. “I have
read of that, too.”</p>

<p>It was a music of many voices, now loud, now soft;
one voice then another spoke above them all; then all
were raised together. Shrill, merry voices running up
and down like laughter; voices as plaintive as the
laughter of loons at dusk; deep, sonorous voices that
suggested courage and endurance. Loseis tried in vain
to pick out the tune. It had a meaning; but one could
not grasp it. It was like listening to the whole world.</p>

<p>“What makes such music?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Orchestra,” he said.</p>

<p>Loseis had met with this word in books; but she did
not know the meaning. She would not ask.</p>

<p>“A whole crowd of instruments together,” said
Gault. “Little fiddles, medium size fiddles, and big
fiddles; wooden horns and brass horns of every size
and shape; and a row of drums.”</p>

<p>“Where is it coming from?” she asked.</p>

<p>“From the station in Calgary.”</p>

<p>Loseis was lifted up on the wings of wonder again.
From Calgary! A thousand miles away! She visualized
the long ten miles ride to the Lake; and tried to
imagine a hundred times ten miles. It was too much;
the mind could not take it in. She thought of the night
outside, and suddenly it became clear to her why the
silence of Northern nights was so profoundly disturbing.
It was not a silence at all; the night was full
of these voices from all over the world, winging
through the sky, and the heart was sensible to them,
though the ears were deaf.</p>

<p>“How do you do it? How do you do it?” murmured
Loseis.</p>

<p>“Oh, it would take old Marconi to explain that,”
said the trader laughing.</p>

<p>Ah! will Paul and I ever listen to such music together?
thought Loseis.</p>

<p>The music came to an end. After a pause a man began
to speak. This affected Loseis even more
strangely than the music. A man speaking to them in
a quiet, friendly voice, as if he was there beside them!
And he was not there. A spirit was amongst them
without its body. Awe gripped Loseis. She shivered,
and looked over her shoulder. Gault watching her,
chuckled, and she shrank sharply into herself again.</p>

<p>The man was giving a humorous account of how he
went with his wife to buy a hat. He spoke of the
crowds of people in the streets, and the gayly decorated
shop windows. Loseis was too much filled with
wonder of the voice to pay heed to the story. He
said: “I met her at the Palliser Hotel this afternoon.”
Yet he was a thousand miles away! He said:
“I took her into the restaurant, and when she said she
wasn’t hungry, I prepared myself for the worst.”
Gault and Moale laughed, and Loseis looked at them
in surprise. A thousand miles! A thousand miles.</p>

<p>It was a jolly, friendly voice that reassured the
child’s heart of Loseis. And it was clear that he was
speaking to others whom he knew to be as honest and
kind as himself. Loseis had a sudden vision of the
populous, kindly world lying outside, and her breast
yearned over it. The friendly voice seemed to bring
her so close, to admit her to that world. But a realization
of her loneliness swept over her. There was that
thousand miles of prairie, muskeg and forest lying between.
Alone! Alone! worse than alone, for she was
hedged about with false and lying men who wished her
ill. Ah! If she could only communicate with the honest
people, they would not let her come to harm.
Drawn quite out of herself, Loseis rose to her feet,
stretching out her arms.</p>

<p>“Oh, if I could only speak to him!” she murmured.</p>

<p>Gault laughed heartily. “That would require a
whole transmitting station,” he said. “Quite a different
matter from getting it.”</p>

<p>Loseis dropped back in her chair. She glanced at
the trader with involuntary dislike. What a coarse
animal under his fine manners! she thought.</p>

<p>When the concert came to an end, Gault said: “To-morrow
night, we’ll get the Slavis into the kitchen,
and spring it on them,” he said laughing. “Lordy!
what a scatteration there will be!”</p>

<p>Loseis got up to go. “You will do what you like, of
course,” she said coldly. “But do not expect me to
come.”</p>

<p>“But why?” asked the surprised Gault.</p>

<p>“It’s a beautiful, wonderful thing,” said Loseis,
looking wistfully at the red box. “I should not care to
see it made a mock of.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, in that case,” said Gault quickly, “no
Slavis! I brought this over solely to give you pleasure,
Princess!”</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>G</span>ault</span> and Moale were breakfasting in the men’s
house.</p>

<p>“How about the fur here?” asked Moale.</p>

<p>“All in good time,” said his master.</p>

<p>“Have you got the key to the warehouse?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But of course I have to make out that it’s
sealed up in the desk.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what you expect to gain by that bit of
flummery,” said Moale.</p>

<p>“No?” said Gault sarcastically. “I am keeping the
girl out of her father’s papers, am I not? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
know what I am doing. Suppose some one should
come in here? Everything would be found in order;
Blackburn’s will, his accounts, his letters. I have
taken nothing, because there was nothing I wanted;
it was sufficient for me to read it all.”</p>

<p>“What was in his will?” said Moale curiously.</p>

<p>“Oh, he left everything to the girl, of course. That
doesn’t signify anything, because if there was no will,
the courts would award it to her anyway.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d like fine to have a look at that fur,” said
Moale with glittering eyes. Fur was his passion. If
he had other passions, he kept them hid.</p>

<p>“You are to keep away from the warehouse for the
present,” said Gault peremptorily.</p>

<p>“I have read the inventory,” said Moale. “There
are ten black fox skins of the first quality. I have
never seen so many at one time. Those alone will
bring from a thousand to fifteen hundred each. Besides
the silver and the cross foxes; the mink, otter
and fisher. The whole lot is worth well above a hundred
thousand at present prices.”</p>

<p>“Quite that,” said Gault. “But I’m playing for a
bigger stake, and I don’t intend to jeopardize it by
making any premature move.”</p>

<p>“How much is the girl worth?” asked Moale slyly.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said the other coolly.</p>

<p>Moale lowered his eyes; he knew very well that
Gault was lying; but did not care to let him see that he
knew. Presently he said: “The news of Blackburn’s
death will be all over by now. That fool Etzooah
let it out at our post before I could stop his mouth.
And Conacher carried the news north with him.”</p>

<p>“I had no thought of keeping it secret,” said Gault.</p>

<p>“How about Gruber, then? If you keep him waiting
too long at the Crossing, he’s likely to come down here
to see what’s up.”</p>

<p>“I’ve written to Gruber telling him that if he will
wait a few weeks, I’ll send him the fur as soon as I
can arrange matters.”</p>

<p>“Maybe that letter won’t satisfy him.”</p>

<p>“Well, if he comes he shall have the fur. It will
be a good way of getting him away from here again.”</p>

<p>“I should hate to see that fur get out of our hands,”
said Moale. “That’s real; that’s the goods! Whereas
the other thing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” He shrugged.</p>

<p>“You’re a fool,” said Gault contemptuously. “The
girl is all but ready to drop into my arms. All I need
is a little time.”</p>

<p>Moale looked down at his plate again.</p>

<p>In spite of the confidence that Gault had expressed,
this conversation brought forward the little worrying
anxiety that lingered in the back of his mind. Here
were the days passing one after another, and could
it be honestly said that he was making progress with
Loseis? Sometimes he was sure he was—sometimes
not so sure. She was such a baffling creature; at one
moment as open and easily moved as a child and the
next moment revealing a maturity of mind and an
originality that startled him. At other times she was
as provoking and secretive as an Indian. To be sure
of late she had been generally friendly, even sympathetic;
but try as he would, he could not get their relations
on the man and woman plane, the plane of
courtship. Loseis eluded him like a sprite.</p>

<p>In his heart Gault cursed the time that must be
wasted in wooing a civilized miss. They managed such
things better in a simpler state of society, when the
girl would have been hit over the head, and dragged
off without more ado. Women have never really
become civilized, he thought; they need to be beaten
still. Well, having an eye to the outside world, he
could not actually do this, but should he not apply the
principle? Perhaps he had been too gentle, too considerate
a wooer. That only set her up in her own
opinion. It was ridiculous to suppose that a mere slip
of a girl who didn’t know her own mind could resist
a mature and strong-willed man like himself. The
time had come for him to overbear her by the mere
force of his personality. She would thank him for it
in the end. A Loseis, humbled and loving; Ah! what
a seductive picture!</p>

<p>Gault had his horse brought, and mounting, rode
across to the Women’s House, well aware that he appeared
to the best advantage on a horse. He knocked
at the door without dismounting, and when Loseis appeared,
she was obliged to look up at him, proudly
holding his seat, and making believe to soothe his
horse, while secretly fretting him with his off heel.
But no light of admiration appeared in Loseis’ clear
eyes. She took horsemanship as a matter of course.</p>

<p>“Will you ride up to the lake with me?” asked
Gault. “I have grub for two. I think you ought to
show yourselves to the Slavis just to remind them that
you are the mistress here.”</p>

<p>Loseis cocked an eye at the sky. It was like an inverted
bowl of palest turquoise. “Surely!” she cried.
“I’m longing for a ride. Give me five minutes to
change my skirt.”</p>

<p>Mary-Rose was sent running to fetch Loseis’ horse.</p>

<p>Loseis and her horse appeared simultaneously.
This was the first time that Gault had beheld the girl’s
riding costume. It comprised Strathcona boots;
breeches; a blue flannel shirt; and a flat-brimmed man’s
hat set crookedly on one side of her head. The shirt
was open at the neck, and under the collar she had
knotted a gay red and yellow kerchief. She turned
up her face to the sky, all open, drinking in the light
with joy; and Gault, observing her hair, softer and
blacker than anything else in Nature, the tender brilliance
of her eyes, and her flower-petal lips, felt a pain
like a needle go through his breast, and lost his sense
of mastery.</p>

<p>He thought: The devil is in it, that she is able to
hurt me so! She must never be allowed to suspect her
power.</p>

<p>Loseis vaulted on her horse. They trotted down
the rise, and passing between the tepees, splashed
through the small stream. Clawing their way up the
further bank, their horses broke into a gallop in the
clean grass. Summer had pronounced her benediction
on the North, and the world was like a freshly painted
picture. Loseis, who was ahead, sang out:</p>

<p>“Oh, what a day for a ride!” To herself she
added: “If that was Conacher pounding along behind,
I should be the happiest girl alive!”</p>

<p>Their way led more or less close to the river. There
were but two horse trails leaving Blackburn’s Post;
that to Fort Good Hope, and this one which, after
circling the easterly shore of Blackburn’s Lake, struck
south to the distant rendezvous near the Crossing.
Rich bottom lands alternated with occasional gravelly
ridges to be crossed. Conversation was impossible;
for horses trained to the trail will not travel abreast;
however Gault, knowing that they would be out all
day, was content to bide his time.</p>

<p>Descending into a lush meadow, already fetlock
deep in grass, Loseis clapped heels to her horse, and
set off, yelling like an Indian. Her sorrel mare laid
her ears back and went like the wind. She would have
yelled too if she could. The sight brought that needle-pain
back to Gault’s breast, by reminding him that
his day for yelling and running was forever past.</p>

<p>In another meadow they came upon a herd of
horses quietly feeding, and Loseis paused to look them
over. These were the broken horses kept on this
side, while the wild horses ranged across the river.
Blackburn on the day he was killed, had been engaged
in rounding up these horses to take out the fur.</p>

<p>When they rode up on top of the ridge which
formed the cut-bank known as Swallow Bend, all
Loseis’ gayety was quenched. She slipped out of her
saddle, and without speaking, handed her rein to Gault
to hold. Creeping to the edge of the bank, she looked
over. In the gravelly stuff below she could easily follow
the marks where the horses had first struck, and
then rolled down into the water. A wild regret filled
her heart, and her tears ran fast.</p>

<p>They were still falling when she returned to Gault,
and silently received her rein. Her grief was as natural
and spontaneous as her gayety had been an hour
before. The ageing man bit his lip and cursed her in
his heart for being so beautiful.</p>

<p>Just below the lake they forded the main stream
through a brawling shallow rapid, the Slavi village being
on the other side. Scores of tepees rose here, as
well as several log shacks built in imitation of the
white man for winter use. Their coming was beheld
from afar, and a tremendous commotion arose in the
village; the news was shrieked from tepee to tepee.
Upon their entrance a dead silence fell; and the Slavis,
like school children all adopted a look of vacant stupidity
as a cover for their embarrassment. Loseis did
not dismount; but rode up and down, speaking to this
one and that.</p>

<p>Tatateecha, the head man of all the Slavis came
to her stirrup. He was a round little man, distinguished
amongst all the tribe by his fleshiness. The
responsibilities of headship had given him more steadiness
of character too, but not much more. Loseis
did not hold him accountable for the excesses at the
Post. Tatateecha made a flowery speech of welcome
to Loseis; and another to Gault.</p>

<p>“You are wasting your breath,” remarked Loseis.
“He does not understand your tongue.”</p>

<p>“Is he the trader now?” asked Tatateecha slyly.</p>

<p>“No!” said Loseis with a flash of her eyes. “He is
my guest.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Do you wish to trade with him?” she
added.</p>

<p>“No! No!” said Tatateecha earnestly. “He has
the name of a hard trader. They tell me that the
people at Fort Good Hope are always poor.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then,” said Loseis. “Serve me, and I
will deal with you justly and fairly as my father did.
You never knew want when he was alive.”</p>

<p>Tatateecha’s eyes twinkled. To be talking in this
manner under the very nose of the proud Gault appealed
to the Slavi sense of humor.</p>

<p>“This man wishes me ill,” Loseis went on. “He
would take my post from me. I look to you and your
people to be my friends, and help me to keep what is
my own.”</p>

<p>Tatateecha in his redskin style swore fealty. Unfortunately
he was not to be trusted far.</p>

<p>“I have another thing to say,” Loseis went on.
“The man who fetched this man into our country—I
do not name him because this man would hear me; you
know the man I mean. That false person is this person’s
spy, so beware how you open your hearts to him.
I have finished.”</p>

<p>Loseis and Gault rode on. They left Tatateecha
looking rather scared, but Loseis told herself that at
least her speaking to him would do no harm.</p>

<p>“What were you talking about?” asked Gault.</p>

<p>“Oh, he was apologizing for the way his people behaved
in the store, and I was telling him it had better
not happen again,” said Loseis carelessly.</p>

<p>Beyond the village the land rose to a low bluff which
commanded a prospect of the lake. Here they turned
out their horses, and sat down in the grass to eat.
After the pleasant, diversified country they had ridden
through, an astonishing panorama met their eyes.
The whole earth suddenly flattened out. They were
upon the only bit of high ground that approached the
lake. In front of them a sea of water and a sea of
grass stretched to the horizon; and it was impossible
to say where the one ended and the other began. On
either hand in the far distance ran the bordering hills.
The only thing there was in sight to break that tremendous
flatness was a flock of wild swans a mile or
more away, fluttering their wings in the sun.</p>

<p>When they had satisfied their hunger, Gault bethought
himself that it was time to take a firm tone
with Loseis. He said bluntly:</p>

<p>“Do you know, you’re a damn pretty girl.”</p>

<p>He prepared himself for an explosion; but Loseis
surprised him again.</p>

<p>“Of course I know it,” she said coolly; looking at
him with a slanting smile.</p>

<p>“How do you know it? You’ve never seen any
white girls.”</p>

<p>“Oh, one knows such things anyhow,” she said
shrugging.</p>

<p>“Has any man ever told you?” demanded Gault.</p>

<p>“No,” said Loseis, clear-eyed as the sky; but thinking
of Conacher nevertheless.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m telling you,” said Gault.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Loseis with a quick smile.</p>

<p>The smile annoyed the trader. It seemed to express
something other than gratitude. “Do you know what
they sometimes call me?” he asked.</p>

<p>Loseis shook her head.</p>

<p>“Kid-Glove Gault. An allusion to my manner, of
course. Everybody knows that it conceals an iron
hand. I have been through a hard school, and I have
come out hard. I choose to be courteous because I
despise those who surround me. I have taught myself
to stand alone.”</p>

<p>Loseis became very uncomfortable. Why does he
tell me all this? she thought.</p>

<p>“Look at me!” he said peremptorily.</p>

<p>She shook her head, pressing her lips together. If
I did, I should burst out laughing in his face, she
thought.</p>

<p>Gault was not ill-pleased by her refusal. It seemed
to testify to his power. “There is another side to my
nature,” he went on, “which I have never revealed to
a living soul. All the softer feelings which other men
scatter in a hundred directions I have saved up for
one!”</p>

<p>Mercy! ejaculated Loseis to herself.</p>

<p>“But it is not to be given lightly,” said Gault. “I
am a proud, jealous, and violent man. I may be led
by one whom I trust, but never driven. I shall never
let down my guard until I am assured that the one I
have chosen is worthy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>This sort of talk put Loseis on pins and needles—she
could not have told why. Her body twitched, and
her face was all drawn up in a knot of comical distaste.
She kept her head averted from Gault. Oh,
if he would <span class='it'>only</span> stop! she was saying to herself.</p>

<p>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of my confidence,” he went on; “such is my
character. I am not trying to excuse it. I have long
been indifferent to both praise and blame. The
woman who places her hand in mine must .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>Loseis could stand no more. Springing to her feet,
she ran back towards the place where the horses were
grazing.</p>

<p>“Excuse me a moment,” she called over her
shoulder. “I must water my horse.”</p>

<p>Gault with a black face had sprung up to follow
her. But he checked himself. That would be <span class='it'>too</span>
ludicrous for one of his years and dignity. Besides,
she could probably run faster than he. He ground
his teeth with rage. “A coquette!” he muttered. “By
God! I’ll tame her!”</p>

<p>All the way home he glowered at her back, but
Loseis could not see that.</p>

<p>After supper she went across to hear the radio concert
in some trepidation; but Gault received her with
his usual smooth and well-controlled face; and she
felt relieved. He treated her with the most exquisite
courtesy. This high manner may have concealed terrible
fires within; but Loseis was not worrying about
that. She gave herself up to the music.</p>

<p>After it was over, Gault walked home with her.
That rare day had been succeeded by a still rarer
night. Low in the southerly sky hung a great round
moon. Measured by the standards of southerly latitudes,
the moon behaves very eccentrically up there.
After describing a short arc across the southern sky,
she would go down in an hour or so not far from
where she had risen. In the meantime she held the
world in a breathless spell of beauty. In that magical
light the rude buildings of the Post created a picture
of old romance. There was a silvery bloom upon the
grass; and the velvety black shadows suggested unutterable
meanings that caught at the heart. The
shadow of Gault’s house reached almost to Loseis’
door.</p>

<p>They paused there; and Loseis looked around her
with a tight breast. (Is he somewhere under this
moon thinking of me?) “This is the night of the
whole year!” she said.</p>

<p>“Well, we are free, white, and twenty-one,” said
Gault. “Why go to bed? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The best place to see
moonlight is on the river. Come out in a canoe with
me for an hour.”</p>

<p>Loseis’ intuition warned her not to go—but one
does not always listen to one’s intuitions. She was
tempted. He can’t do any more than talk, she
thought; I guess I can stand it. I shall be looking
at the moonlight, and thinking of the other one.
“Very well,” she said.</p>

<p>“Go in and get a coat,” he said. “I’ll come back
for you in two minutes.”</p>

<p>He hastened back to his own kitchen. One of his
Crees was sent down to the creek mouth to find a
canoe. Of the others, one played a banjo and all
could sing the old-fashioned songs that are still current
in the far North. These were stationed on a
bench outside the kitchen door with orders to sing,
<span class='it'>not loud</span>. After all there was something magnificent
about Gault. In his dark way he had imagination.
But he was fifty-three years old!</p>

<p>When they got down to the water’s edge the Cree
was holding the canoe for them to step into. By
Gault’s orders he had chosen not one of the usual bark
canoes of the Slavis which are little more than paper
boats, but a dug-out of which there were several lying
in the creek. These heavier and roomier craft are
however, no more stable than the others. Loseis perceived
that a nest of blankets and pillows had been
arranged for her in the bottom.</p>

<p>“Oh, I like to paddle,” she said.</p>

<p>“Give me the pleasure of looking at you in the
moonlight,” murmured Gault.</p>

<p>Again Loseis felt strong compunctions; but it
seemed too ridiculous to back out then; especially with
the Indian looking on. She got in; and Gault, taking
his place in the stern, paddled out into the main
stream.</p>

<p>Heading the canoe down river, he allowed it to
drift. That brought Loseis reclining under his eyes
in the full shine of the moon; while he, sitting up on
the thwart, was blackly silhouetted against the light.
Presumably it was very lovely on the river—Loseis
observed how the face of the water seemed to be
powdered with moon-dust; and at any other time her
heart would have been melted by the distant strumming
of the banjo, and the muted voices; but now it
was all spoiled for her by that silhouette. How
could she think of Conacher while the other man’s
eyes were boring into her. She was sorry she had
come. She became sorrier when Gault began to
speak.</p>

<p>“You are beautiful!” he said in a masterful voice.
“I want you!”</p>

<p>At first Loseis was only conscious of astonishment.</p>

<p>“Want me?” she echoed blankly.</p>

<p>“To-morrow I shall send over to my Post for the
parson,” he went on, coolly. “He may bring his sister
with him to attend upon you. We shall be married
in your house. It will be more fitting.”</p>

<p>Loseis was literally struck dumb. She sat up
straight, trying to peer into the shadowy face that
was almost invisible to her, her mouth hanging open
like a child’s.</p>

<p>Gault laughed fondly. “Do not look so frightened,”
he murmured. “I will take good care of you
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. little sweetheart.”</p>

<p>A little strained note of laughter was surprised out
of the girl. The last word sounded so funny, shaped
by those stiff old lips.</p>

<p>Gault ascribed it to nerves. It did not put him off
at all. “As soon as we are married,” he went on.
“Let us take advantage of the Summer season to make
a trip outside. A handsome spirited girl like you will
enjoy seeing the cities. You shall have everything that
your heart desires. And we will be able to attend
to the business of your father’s estate. I don’t mean
places like Edmonton or Calgary. What would you
say to New York .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. London?”</p>

<p>As he talked on a chill of terror struck to Loseis’
breast. He seemed so very sure of himself! The
fond, elderly voice made her feel like a little girl
again. “Do I <span class='it'>have to</span> marry him?” she asked herself,
trembling.</p>

<p>The river was very high. The muddy borders
which would show themselves later, were now completely
covered. The overhanging willows trailed
their branches in deep water. Without noticing it,
they had drifted close to the easterly shore.</p>

<p>Gault’s ardor increased. He dropped forward in
the bottom of the dug-out, and crept closer to Loseis.
Putting a hand down on either side of her for support
and balance, he strained towards her. Loseis
got a hateful whiff of the scented breath again.</p>

<p>“Seal it with a kiss, sweetheart,” he murmured.</p>

<p>Loseis’ blood rebelled, and all uncertainty left her.
She was no longer the child, but an aroused woman.
She wriggled her body further forward in the dug-out,
out of his reach.</p>

<p>“Easy! Easy!” he cried sharply; “or you’ll have
us over!”</p>

<p>“Marry you!” cried Loseis with a burst of clear
laughter that flayed him raw. “You ugly old man!
The husband I have chosen is not like you!”</p>

<p>Gault drew in his breath with a moan of rage; and,
careless of the danger, began to creep towards her.
At that instant a willow branch brushed against the
girl’s hair. Springing up, Loseis embraced a whole
mass of the leaves within her arms, and swung herself
out. Under the violent propulsion of her body, the
narrow craft rolled over in a twinkling, and Gault was
precipitated into the water.</p>

<p>Loseis sank into the icy water up to her neck, and
hung there, dangling from her branches. For a moment
there was silence; then Gault’s head emerged
from the river, and the night was shattered by a roar
for help. Loseis saw him seize the canoe, and knew
that he was in no danger of drowning. He was no
more than twenty feet from her, but drifting away on
the current.</p>

<p>Loseis worked her way along her slender branches,
to thicker branches, and finally gained a footing on
firm ground. Gault, drifting downstream continued
to roar for help. Making her way across the flat below
the Post, Loseis met Moale, and the Crees running
in response to their master’s cries. The Slavi
village was in an uproar.</p>

<p>“Gault is in the river,” said Loseis coolly. “He’s
in no danger. Get canoes and go after him.”</p>

<p>Reaching her own house Loseis found the terror-stricken
girls huddled in a group. At the sight of
her drenched clothing, Mary-Lou clasped her hands
tragically.</p>

<p>“What has happened?” she gasped.</p>

<p>Loseis did not answer her immediately, but only
leaned back against the door with widening eyes. For
suddenly she had realized what <span class='it'>had</span> happened, and
was appalled by the certain consequences. She alone
there with that pack of terrified girls!</p>

<p>“Bar the door,” she said. “Shutter the windows.
We’ll have to stand a siege now! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. No, wait!”
she cried as they moved to obey her. “We must have
weapons. The men won’t be back for half an hour.
I’ll fetch guns from the store!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span><h1>CHAPTER X<br/> <span class='sub-head'>CONTRABAND</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>ll</span> night long Loseis and her girls listened in
trepidation, but none approached their house.
In the morning, Loseis, disdaining to remain under
cover any longer, sallied out of the house to find
Gault, and have it out with him. Anything was better
than uncertainty.</p>

<p>The trader was at breakfast in the kitchen of the
men’s house. Seeing Loseis at the door, he rose
quickly, showing a smooth, composed face, but with
eyes as hard as agate. “Good morning,” he said with
extreme politeness; “I trust that you received no hurt
from your ducking last night. I was coming over
directly to inquire. How inexcusably careless of me!
I shall never forgive myself!”</p>

<p>Loseis waved all this aside. “I should like a few
words with you,” she said as politely as he.</p>

<p>“Please come in,” said Gault. He indicated the
inner room.</p>

<p>“I would be glad if you would step outside,” said
Loseis.</p>

<p>“Certainly!”</p>

<p>They walked away from the door, followed by the
sharp, secret glances of the Crees. Gault rubbed his
upper lip. Under the mask he wore, an uneasiness
made itself felt. Certainly he had not expected Loseis
to look him up, nor could he guess what was coming.</p>

<p>She wasted no words in coming to the point. “When
you heard of my father’s death you hastened over
here to help me, you said. If your intentions were
good, I thank you.”</p>

<p>“Do you doubt it?” asked Gault sharply.</p>

<p>She spread out her hands. “What difference does
that make now? Whether you wished to help me or
not it would be impossible under the present circumstances.”
She paused for a moment. It required a
strong nerve to say this to Andrew Gault. “I must
therefore ask you to leave the Post as soon as possible.”</p>

<p>There was a silence. Gault stared at her incredulously.
In spite of his iron self-control a blackish
flush spread under his skin. Infernal passions
were raging under his mask. But he fought them
down. He said nothing. He fell back a step, that
Loseis could not see his face without turning squarely
around.</p>

<p>“Well?” she said sharply. “Have you nothing to
say?”</p>

<p>“What is there to say?” he murmured.</p>

<p>“You could refuse to go,” said Loseis proudly.
“If you refused to go, of course I could not make
you.”</p>

<p>“I could not refuse,” said Gault with a sort of hollow
reverberation of his usual full and courteous
tones. “You put me in an extraordinarily difficult
position. I do not think you should be left alone here;
but of course I cannot stay.”</p>

<p>“I shall manage very well,” said Loseis.</p>

<p>“I am sorry you think so badly of me,” said Gault.</p>

<p>“Oh, I shall not think badly of you, if you will only
leave me alone,” said Loseis quickly. “I shall always
be grateful to you!”</p>

<p>Silence again. Gault literally ground his teeth.
After awhile he was able to say: “You are mixing up
two things together.”</p>

<p>“You are mistaken,” said Loseis. “The two things
are quite separate in my mind. I have had all night
to think them over.”</p>

<p>“Do you wish me to leave Mr. Moale here to assist
you?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” said Loseis firmly. “Furthermore,
I should be greatly obliged if you would carry
Etzooah back with you.”</p>

<p>For the fraction of a second the flames broke
through Gault’s mask. “Suppose you needed a messenger!”
he cried.</p>

<p>“I should not choose Etzooah to be my messenger,”
said Loseis quietly.</p>

<p>He quickly controlled himself. “Very well,” he
said; “we will be off as soon as we can get our traps
together. Say to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“Oh, suit your convenience, of course,” said Loseis
politely.</p>

<p>Gault’s expression changed. His hard eyes turned
askance on the girl. “Upon consideration,” he said,
more smoothly than before, “I am sure we will be able
to get away late this afternoon. We can make our
first camp up on the prairie, where we will at least be
out of your sight.”</p>

<p>Loseis bowed; and they parted out in the middle of
the little square.</p>

<p>When Gault re-entered the kitchen of the men’s
house, he did not speak. The expression on his face
was frightful to see. One by one the Crees, making
believe to have noticed nothing amiss, slipped outside.
Even Moale did not care to face that look. He
sauntered out after the others. Gault sat down as if
to finish his meal; but he touched no food. He merely
sat there with his hands on the edge of the table and
his head lowered, thinking; thinking.</p>

<p>Finally he rose; and going into Blackburn’s room,
coolly produced a key, with which he opened a wall
cupboard. From it he took an earthenware jug, one
of several on the shelves; and locking up the cupboard,
carried the jug back to the kitchen table. Removing
the cork, he smelled of the contents, but did
not taste. It was a known thing in the country that
Gault was not a drinking man. He called out to have
Etzooah sent to him.</p>

<p>When the grinning Indian stood before him, Gault
said curtly: “This afternoon, just before supper time,
I shall be starting away from here. You are to come
with me.”</p>

<p>Etzooah nodded.</p>

<p>“Etzooah,” the trader continued, fixing his burning
glance on the man, “do the Slavis know the taste of
whisky?”</p>

<p>“Wah!” said the Indian, showing his blackened
teeth; “Tatateecha know it. And some of the old
men. Twenty-five years ago there was a party of
Klondikers went down this river. They had whisky.
They hand it round. Blackburn had whisky too, but
he did not give the people any.”</p>

<p>“Can you teach the younger men to drink it?” asked
Gault with an ugly smile.</p>

<p>“Wah!” said Etzooah, with his silent laugh. “No
need teach! All know what whisky is. The story of
the white man’s stomach-warming medicine is often
told over the fire.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said Gault. “When we leave here to-day,
you may take them that jug of Blackburn’s whisky.
Let it be carried out of the house with the other
things when we are packing up. Just before we start,
you may go down behind the house, that the white
women may not see you, and give it to Mahtsonza for
all. Do not tell them that I sent it. Say that you
found it in Blackburn’s room, and I never missed it,
because I am not a whisky-drinker.” Gault leaned
across the table, and lowered his voice. “And tell
them as if not meaning anything by it, that there are
four more jugs in the little cupboard on the wall of
Blackburn’s room.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Etzooah, grinning still. “What if
there is trouble after?”</p>

<p>“I’ll take care of that,” said Gault coolly. He had
recovered his self-control.</p>

<p>“All right. All right,” said Etzooah.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>During the course of the day, Loseis cast many an
anxious glance across the way. Certain obvious preparations
for departure were immediately set under
way; the pole on the roof was taken down, and the
wire rolled up on spools; the pack-horses which had
been turned out in the meadow across the creek, were
rounded up, and driven into the corral attached to
Blackburn’s stable. So much done, Gault could have
left within an hour had he chosen, but a long time
passed before any further move was made.</p>

<p>Finally, towards the end of the afternoon, the
Crees began to carry their bedding rolls out of the
kitchen. The horses were led out and saddled, their
packs adjusted, and the hitches thrown. By five
o’clock all was ready for the start. After another
wait, Gault came marching over to the Women’s
House. Loseis met him at the door.</p>

<p>Exhibiting his finest manner, he smiled politely.
“I know this must be disagreeable to you,” he said,
“but I thought it better to keep up appearances before
my servants and yours. I have come to say good-by.”</p>

<p>“I was expecting you,” said Loseis. “I wish to return
the various gifts which you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” said Gault sharply. “Do not put that
slight upon me before these redskins. Surely you
have done enough.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Loseis, “if you feel that way about it,
it does not matter, of course.”</p>

<p>He immediately recovered himself. “Let us appear
to take a friendly good-by of each other.”</p>

<p>“Surely,” said Loseis. “Perhaps you will take a
letter out for me? I understand that the mail is carried
from Fort Good Hope every month.”</p>

<p>“Charmed!” said Gault.</p>

<p>She gave him the letter which had been written during
the afternoon. It was addressed to Gruber at the
Crossing. She realized that if the first letters had
not been sent out, this one would hardly be allowed to
go; still, it was a chance that must not be neglected.</p>

<p>Gault, standing hat in hand, said with his polite
smile: “I shall give myself the pleasure of sending
over from time to time, until assistance reaches you
from the outside. Though you repudiate it, I still
feel responsible for you.”</p>

<p>Loseis smiled back—a little quizzically. Is it worth
it? her smile said.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” said Gault, putting out his hand.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” said Loseis, letting hers lie within it.</p>

<p>He strode back to his waiting party, and swung himself
into the saddle. The Crees cried to the pack-horses,
and all set off briskly out of the inclosure, disappearing
behind the store. Presently they were to
be seen on the trail above, trotting up the incline;
smart, well-found, arrogant, modeled upon the style
of the old Company. Loseis breathed more freely.
To be sure, they were not gone yet, for Gault had
said they would camp for the night on the edge of
the prairie. She was not in the least deceived by his
politeness. There would be another night of anxiety
to face, but not so keen as the previous night; for the
violence of his rage must have abated somewhat.
Loseis realized that she had not so much to fear from
violence now, as from the man’s cold craft.</p>

<p>She went into her house. The supper was waiting.
The thoughtless red girls, thinking only that Gault
was gone, were all smiles. Loseis had Mary-Lou to
sit down with her at table, in the effort to keep at bay
that ghastly feeling of solitude that crept over her
like the coming of night. Alone! Alone! Alone!
And so long before she could hope for succor! She
gave the girls a highly comic account of Gault’s proposal
the night before, laughing loudly herself. Anything
to keep the bogies at bay!</p>

<p>It was about an hour afterwards when they first began
to realize that something was amiss in the Slavi
village. There was an ungodly sound of singing going
on. The Slavis frequently made the twilight hours
hideous with their wordless chanting. Loseis was accustomed
to it. To-night it was different; it had an
insane ring; they were burlesquing their own performance,
and screaming with laughter. It was significant
too, that the voices of the women were not to
be heard. Loseis scarcely knew what drunkenness
meant, or she would have understood sooner.</p>

<p>She went to the little window at the end of the room
which overlooked the river flat. Though it was eight
o’clock the sun had not yet dropped out of sight. All
the Slavi men were gathered in a rough circle around
a fire on the creek bank. There was no order in the
company; some lay about; some danced with extravagant
gestures. The ordinary dance of the Slavis was
a decorous shuffle. The women were nowhere to be
seen. Every moment the scene became more confused,
and the yelling louder.</p>

<p>Leaving the window, Loseis said: “I am going down
to see what is the matter.”</p>

<p>Mary-Lou flung herself upon her mistress: “No!
No! No!” she cried in despair.</p>

<p>Loseis was very pale. She firmly detached the
clinging hands. “There is nothing else to be done,”
she said simply. “If I do not notice this, my influence
over them is gone!”</p>

<p>Loseis went sedately down the grassy rise, neither
hurrying, nor hanging back. Her back was straight;
her face composed. Her look of proud scorn lent a
strange poignancy to her childishness. Her heart
might have been fluttering like a frightened child’s,
but nobody could have guessed it. Mary-Lou, seeing
her face, wept aloud, without knowing what it was
that had moved her so.</p>

<p>As Loseis came near, the Slavis around the fire fell
quiet and still. Only one of them jumped up, and ran
away, carrying something. Loseis recognized the
figure of Mahtsonza. He ran across the stepping-stones
of the creek, and climbed up the further bank.
The rest of them were orderly enough now: but their
drunken, swimming eyes and hanging mouths told a
tale.</p>

<p>Loseis stepped into the middle of the circle.
“What means this howling that beats against my
ears?” she demanded. “Are your brains full of ice?
(The Slavi phrase for insanity.) Is this a pack of
coyotes or men?”</p>

<p>None answered her. They merely looked stupid.</p>

<p>Mahtsonza, a furlong off by this time, and feeling
himself safe, turned around exhibiting the earthenware
jug. He insolently turned it up to his lips.</p>

<p>Loseis recognized the style of the jug. Her heart
sank at the young man’s act of open defiance; but no
muscle of her face changed. “Now I understand,”
she said coldly. “Blackburn’s whisky has been
stolen.”</p>

<p>“No steal,” muttered the man called Ahchoogah.
“It was a gift.”</p>

<p>“Who gave it?” demanded Loseis.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>Loseis stepped to the nearest tepee, and stuck her
head through the opening. Within, a crowd of dejected
women and children, crouched around a tiny
fire on the ground.</p>

<p>“Where did they get it?” demanded Loseis.</p>

<p>A voice answered: “Etzooah brought it.”</p>

<p>All was clear to Loseis. She sickened with disgust
that a man big and powerful as Gault could stoop to
so cowardly a trick.</p>

<p>Returning to the men she said in a voice of scorn:
“Call Mahtsonza back. Drink what is left. Drink
until you lie like rotten logs! When you return to
yourselves you shall be punished!”</p>

<p>By this she meant that a fine would be entered
against each man’s name on the books. Letting her
eyes sweep around the circle as if to fix each face in
her memory, she stepped out of the circle, and returned
to her house without looking back.</p>

<p>The moment the door closed after her, the yelling
broke out again, now with a clear note of defiance and
derision. They wished her to understand that though
they could not face out her strong glance, behind her
back they spat at her. Looking out of the end
window she could see them capering about, indulging
like children in an outrageous pantomime of derision
directed towards her house. Loseis quickly turned
away. It was a bitter, bitter dose for her pride to
swallow. “They should be whipped! They should
be whipped!” she said, with the tears of anger springing
to her eyes.</p>

<p>However, she felt a little better when she reflected
that there was only one gallon of whisky between
about forty men. It was only because they were
totally unused to the stuff that it had affected them
as quickly and so violently. The effect could not last
long.</p>

<p>As on a former occasion at the suggestion of
danger, Loseis found that the three Slavi girls had
quietly vanished. “Let them go!” she said shrugging.
“They would only be in our way.”</p>

<p>Loseis determined that she and Mary-Lou should
sleep in the store. As long as she could keep them
out of the store, she held the whip hand. When the
two of them appeared outside the house, carrying their
beds across the square, jeers and yells greeted them
from below. Mary-Lou’s coppery cheeks turned
grayish with fear; but Loseis’ chin went higher.</p>

<p>“Cowardly dogs!” she said. “If I went down there,
their voices would dry up in their throats.”</p>

<p>As soon as it began to grow dark, she set the lighted
lamp in the window of the store, to remind the Slavis
that she was on guard.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the whole gang swept up into
the little square within the buildings. They all carried
branches and sticks; one or two had lighted brands
from the fire below. Yelling and capering like
demons, they piled their fuel in the center of the space,
and set fire to it. In a few seconds the flames were
leaping high, illuminating every corner of the square,
and throwing the fantastic leaping shadows of the savages
against the house fronts. Through the little window
of the store, Loseis watched them with a stony
face. To bring their orgy within the very confines of
the Post! A hideous chill struck into her breast. If
they dared so far, what might they not dare!</p>

<p>Soon, like the savages they were, they lost interest
in their bonfire. The noise quieted down somewhat.
Loseis ventured to hope that the effect of the spirit
might be beginning to wear off. The jug was not
visible. Presently she noticed that their attention was
concentrated on her father’s house. Some of them
were nosing around it like animals; others stood senselessly
trying to peer through the dark panes; near the
door a man was haranguing his fellows, waving his
hand towards the house, Loseis could not hear his
words.</p>

<p>The crowd around the door increased. Finally one
ventured to put his hand on the latch. The door was
not locked. It swung inward, and all the Slavis fell
backward in affright. The same man who had opened
the door, crept back on all fours, and sticking his head
inside, uttered a senseless yell. The others shrieked
with laughter. Still, they dared not venture in. They
gathered together in a close body outside the door,
and the sound of their jabbering reached Loseis
faintly. Suddenly those at the back began to push,
and the first ones were thrust inside. Instantly they
all swept in. With a sickness of the heart, Loseis saw
one run back to the fire, and snatch up a pine branch
with a burning end.</p>

<p>The girl groaned. It affected her like an act of sacrilege.
Blackburn was indeed dead when these miserable
savages feared not to overrun his house. She
expected to see his private papers scattered out of the
door; she waited for the house to burst into flames.</p>

<p>However, destruction was not their present aim.
They reappeared almost immediately, yelling in triumph.
He who came first held another jug aloft; and
others followed; Loseis counted: two .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. three .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
four! Her chin went down on her breast. Well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
this is the end, she thought.</p>

<p>Mary-Lou had seen, too. “Quick! we must go!”
she gasped. “They will kill now! Quick! through
the little window at the back!”</p>

<p>Loseis slowly shook her head. “No! You can go.
I stay. As long as I am here they will not dare to
enter the store.”</p>

<p>“Look! Look!” cried Mary-Lou. “What they
care now? They will kill you!”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Loseis somberly; “but I will not run
from Slavis. You go.”</p>

<p>Mary-Lou dropped to her knees, and hid her face
in Loseis’ skirt. “No! No!” she whispered. “I
never leave you.”</p>

<p>Pandemonium had broken loose outside. Some had
rifled Blackburn’s wood pile; and armful after armful
of fresh fuel was thrown on the fire. The Slavis took
leave of what little humanity they had. The jugs
were snatched from hand to hand; tipped up to thirsty
mouths; and snatched away again. But even in their
drunkenness they did not fight amongst themselves.
The fighting instinct was absent in this degenerate
people. It was an ugly thing to see the miserable little
creatures, born under the shadow of fear, and obliged
to cringe to all men, now released of their fears by
whisky. They expressed their freedom by throwing
their heads back and howling like dogs; and by
dancing around the fire with legs and arms all abroad
like jumping-jacks. The great, round moon, rising a
little higher to-night, looked down on this scene with
her accustomed serenity.</p>

<p>Finally they began to turn their attention to the
store. At first they did not dare to approach; but one
or another would hide behind his fellows and squall
derisively in the direction of Loseis. The others
would laugh in the childish way of savages. These
were merely animal cries, without words. Later
Loseis began to hear the word Burn! cried from one
to another. She shivered internally. Meanwhile the
jugs were still circulating, rousing them to a pitch of
frenzy.</p>

<p>At last a man snatched up a stick with a burning
end. Instantly a dozen others followed his example.
Loseis knocked out a pane of glass with her elbow;
and put the barrel of her gun through the hole.</p>

<p>But the Slavis never reached the store. Something
caused them to freeze where they stood. The whole
mad, shifting scene suddenly became fixed like a
picture. Then they dropped their torches and fled;
vanishing in the silent manner peculiar to themselves.
You could scarcely see how it happened; you looked
again, and they were not there. A moment or two
after the sound had reached their ears it came to
Loseis within the house. It was the distant pounding
of many hoofs on the trail.</p>

<p>When Gault and his men rode into the little square,
Loseis was standing at the open door of the store.
She still had the gun over her arm. Gault flung himself
off his horse.</p>

<p>“Good God! what has happened?” he cried. “I
heard the racket clear to my camp, and jumped on my
horse. Are you hurt?”</p>

<p>Loseis slowly shook her head.</p>

<p>“Is any damage done?”</p>

<p>Loseis indicated the empty jugs lying scattered
about. “None; except that my father’s whisky has
been drunk up,” she said dryly.</p>

<p>“My God!” cried Gault. “The brutes! I hated to
leave you this afternoon, but I didn’t expect to see my
fears materialize this way. Now you see, don’t you,
that I was right. You cannot be left here alone.”</p>

<p>Loseis did not speak. She looked at him steadily,
her lips curving in a slow smile of scorn. She was
thinking: Let him babble! It only makes him out a
fool. I shall not tell him all I know. To keep silence
gives me a power over him.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span><h1>CHAPTER XI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A MEETING</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>longside</span> a vast inland sea whose further
shores were lost under the horizon, a tall young
white man was cooking his supper in the open. The
meal was going to be better than usual, for, having
been camped in the same spot for a week, he had
been able to secure game. On a spit before an ingeniously
constructed fireplace of stones, a wild goose
was roasting. The young man turned the spit, and
basted his fowl. He kept the wooden spit from catching
fire by the simple expedient of basting that
also. At a little distance two Indians looked on with
covert scorn at their master’s elaborate arrangements.
What a lot of trouble to take to eat! They had been
content to impale their goose for awhile on a stick
inclined over the fire; whence they snatched it scorched
on one side and raw on the other.</p>

<p>The young man, while taking an innocent pleasure
in his own ingenuity, was thinking how unsatisfactory it
was to cook your own dinner. When it first began to
sizzle you became weak with hunger; but the continued
spectacle took the fine edge off your appetite
long before the meat was done.</p>

<p>A dug-out nosed its slender length around a near
point, and a shrill hail electrified them all.</p>

<p>“Conacher, thank God!” cried the young man.</p>

<p>The two Indians ran down to the water’s edge; but
their master would not leave his goose which was
browning beautifully.</p>

<p>From the dug-out landed an exactly similar outfit;
that is to say a tall young white man and two Indians.
The two white men clasped hands, and their eyes
beamed on each other. However, they were shy of
betraying emotion before the reds, and their greeting
was distinctly casual.</p>

<p>“Hello, old bean! Where the hell you been? The
boss has gone down the lake, leaving me to fetch you.
Do you know that you’ve held up the whole blooming
survey?”</p>

<p>“It’s a long story,” said Conacher. “Oh boy! is
that a roast goose I see? Let me get my teeth into it,
and then I’ll tell you.”</p>

<p>When they had thoroughly discussed the goose,
they lighted their pipes; and Alec Jordan invited
Conacher to fire away. Jordan was about three years
older than Conacher; and they were tried friends.
The Indians around their own fire, were out of earshot.</p>

<p>“What delayed you?” said Jordan. “It was downstream
work all the way.”</p>

<p>“Gad! it’s good to have a white man to talk to!”
said Conacher. “I’m damn thankful it’s you, old
scout. I couldn’t have told the others.”</p>

<p>“But why this emotion?” asked Jordan humorously.</p>

<p>“Well, it concerns a woman,” said Conacher, looking
away.</p>

<p>His friend’s face hardened. “An Indian?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“No, damn you!” cried Conacher indignantly.
“What do you think I am?”</p>

<p>Jordan opened his eyes. “But between here and the
Rocky Mountains,” he said, “around Blackburn’s
Lake, and down Blackburn’s River, what else is
there?”</p>

<p>“There is Blackburn’s daughter?” murmured Conacher.</p>

<p>“Oho!” cried Jordan. “I forgot about her.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Indeed, I thought she was still a little girl.”</p>

<p>“Don’t josh it!” muttered Conacher. “This is the
real thing.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, old man,” said Jordan, touching his
shoulder.</p>

<p>“Blackburn is dead,” said Conacher.</p>

<p>“I knew it,” said Jordan. “The boss knew it, too.
But it never occurred to us to connect your delay with
his death. We figured you would have been past his
Post before the date of his death.”</p>

<p>“I was,” said Conacher. “But I went back.”</p>

<p>He went on to tell the whole story; how he had first
come to Blackburn’s Post, of the trader’s ungracious
reception and the daughter’s scornful one; how he had
gone on down the river; how the little raft had come
floating by his camp with the pathetic black streamer;
and how, yielding to an impulse that he had scarcely
understood, he had hastened up-stream. He ended his
story with the coming of Andrew Gault to Blackburn’s
Post.</p>

<p>“I could leave her then with an easier mind,” he
said. “Gault knew everything to do.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” said Jordan; but in so uncertain a tone, that
Conacher asked him sharply:</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>Jordan looked at him queerly; and the lover’s anxious
heart was filled with alarm.</p>

<p>“What are you keeping back?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“I don’t know as I ought to tell you,” said Jordan
slowly.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“It’s just gossip. We’ve got our work to do.”</p>

<p>“Do you put me or our work first?” demanded Conacher.</p>

<p>“Well, since you put it that way, you!” said Jordan.</p>

<p>“Then tell me.”</p>

<p>“But what can you do, now?”</p>

<p>“Never mind. You tell me, and I’ll make up my
mind what I can do. I’m a grown man.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Jordan, “when you told me that Gault
had come to the aid of Blackburn’s daughter I couldn’t
help but think it was like the wolf coming to save the
lamb.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” said Conacher impatiently, “something
of that sort occurred to me, but hang it all! no
white man could be blackguard enough to take advantage
of a young girl in that situation!”</p>

<p>Jordan smiled affectionately at his friend. “You’re
young, my son,” he murmured. “I don’t know as I
would put it by Gault.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I suppose you’ve never
heard the full story of Blackburn and Gault?”</p>

<p>“No, how should I?” said Conacher. “Coming
from the mountains.”</p>

<p>“True, this is your first season. I’ve been in the
country three summers, and I’ve picked up all the gossip.
It’s one of the stock stories of the country how
Blackburn and Gault have been fighting each other
for twenty years, and Blackburn has beaten out Gault
at every turn. Gault had to obtain financial assistance
outside. But here’s a new piece of information that
came to me pretty straight. Nothing can be hidden in
this country. It seems that Ogilvie, Gault’s backer,
told Gault on his last visit to Fort Good Hope that
the Company would fire him if he didn’t succeed in
putting Blackburn out of business.”</p>

<p>Conacher’s face darkened with anxiety. “I wish I
had known that!” he muttered. “How did you hear
of Blackburn’s death?”</p>

<p>“Yesterday, before the boss pulled out, we got mail
from Good Hope by the half-breed Modest Capeau.
When he left the fort the news of Blackburn’s death
had come; and Gault had gone over there.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
Jordan hesitated, with an embarrassed glance at his
friend.</p>

<p>“Well, out with it!” said Conacher sharply.</p>

<p>Jordan shrugged. “According to the gossip at Fort
Good Hope, Gault said that he was going to marry
the girl.”</p>

<p>Conacher jumped up. “Oh, my God!” he cried
agitatedly. “That old man! What the devil will I
do!”</p>

<p>Jordan followed him. “How about the girl?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“She loves me, Alec,” said Conacher simply.</p>

<p>Jordan gripped his shoulder. “Old fellow .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
you deserve to be happy!” he said warmly.</p>

<p>“Happy!” cried Conacher bitterly. “I never should
have left her!”</p>

<p>“But you had to leave her.”</p>

<p>“Oh hell, what does the government matter in a
case like this.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Wait a minute. I must try to
think this out. How far can you trust this gossip?”</p>

<p>“Well I’m bound to say this is more than common
gossip,” admitted Jordan. “It was Joe Moale, the
man closest to Gault, who told the fellows he had
heard Gault swear that he would marry the girl.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
But she won’t have him, of course. No doubt everything
will be all right.”</p>

<p>“Oh, God! don’t try to smooth things down!” cried
Conacher. “She is completely in his power. The only
Indian who could speak English was murdered .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Of course she’ll reject him! And then what? Then
what? Oh, my God! think of the girl being left in
the power of the man she had turned down! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
I never should have left her. But how could I stay
with all you waiting for me? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, it’s different
now. I’ve done the bit of work that was entrusted to
me. I can put all the data in your hands. After this
they can get along without me if they have to.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>“My God! Paul, what are you talking about?”</p>

<p>“I’m going back,” said Conacher quietly.</p>

<p>“You <span class='it'>can’t</span> go back! Think of the row that would
be kicked up!”</p>

<p>“I’ll have to face it.”</p>

<p>“You’ll lose your job. Where will you get another?”</p>

<p>“It’s true, nobody wants a geologist but the government.
But I’m young; I’ll make out somehow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, my God! this is terrible!” cried Jordan.
“We’re so shorthanded already!”</p>

<p>“Do you blame me?” demanded Conacher.</p>

<p>Jordan’s expression changed. “No, I don’t blame
you, really,” he said. “Go on back, and God bless
you! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But it’s me that’s got to face the boss.
You know what he is. At the first mention of a girl
he will think the worst. He’s depending on your
Indians, too.”</p>

<p>“Take them,” said Conacher. “Your dug-out is
big enough to carry all five. I couldn’t pay them anyhow.
All I want of the government is enough grub
to see me through.”</p>

<p>“It’s foolhardy to travel alone!” cried Jordan.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” said Conacher. “I’m not going
to break a leg this trip. I can’t afford to. The only
thing that bothers me is, it’s all up-stream work. I
can’t make but twenty miles a day.”</p>

<p>“I wish it was me,” said Jordan enviously.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span><h1>CHAPTER XII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>FUR</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>Q</span>uite</span> early in the morning, Loseis, issuing out
of her house, was greatly astonished to see the
door of the little fur warehouse standing open, and
the bales of fur being carried out by Gault’s Crees.
This warehouse flanked the store on the left hand side
as you faced the river; on the other side there was a
similar building for the storage of flour. Loseis’
breast grew hot at the sight; and without more ado,
she marched across. Gault was not in sight; Moale
was directing the Crees.</p>

<p>“What does this mean?” demanded Loseis.</p>

<p>Moale turned his flat, inscrutable black eyes to the
girl’s face. The dash of Indian blood lent a touch
of mystery to Moale’s olive face. It was a comely
face; but so expressionless it was impossible to tell the
man’s age. “I beg your pardon?” he said in his pleasant
voice.</p>

<p>“You heard me!” said Loseis in a passion. “By
what authority have you broken into my warehouse,
and helped yourself to my fur?”</p>

<p>It was quite true that Moale had opened one of the
bales for no reason except the pleasure of seeing and
stroking the marvelous pelts of the black foxes. He
was a connoisseur. He said smoothly: “Mr. Gault’s
orders, Miss. I thought you knew.”</p>

<p>“I did not know,” said Loseis, “and I will trouble
you to have the fur carried back again, and the door
locked.”</p>

<p>Moale scratched his head. “I’d be glad if you’d
talk it over with Mr. Gault,” he said.</p>

<p>Loseis imperiously beckoned to the nearest Cree.
“Man!” she said, “tell Gault that I would be glad to
have a few words with him.”</p>

<p>While they waited for Gault, Moale busied himself
with tying up the opened bale. He did not speak; but
he looked at Loseis curiously and wistfully, when she
was not aware of it.</p>

<p>Gault was presently to be seen approaching from
the men’s house. He did not hurry himself. “Good
morning,” he said, raising his hat. His manner had
changed. He was still polite, but it was an insolent
politeness. His eyes were as hard as glass.</p>

<p>Loseis welcomed the change. It permitted her to
come out into the open. “Why did you give orders
to get out my fur?” she asked.</p>

<p>“It must be sent outside without further delay,”
said Gault coolly.</p>

<p>“Am I not to be consulted?” asked Loseis, running
up her eye-brows.</p>

<p>“It did not seem worth while to do so,” said Gault.
“You have set yourself in opposition to me at every
point. Just the same I have a responsibility towards
you that I am obliged to fulfill.”</p>

<p>“I am the mistress here,” said Loseis in a rage.</p>

<p>“You are not of age,” said Gault coolly.</p>

<p>“Well, you are not my guardian!”</p>

<p>“No. But whoever may take your affairs in charge,
will look to me as the only man on the spot, for an
accounting. If the fur is not sent out at once you
would lose the market for an entire season.”</p>

<p>Loseis turned away biting her lip. Whenever he began
to talk in this vein with glib use of legal and business
terms, she was helpless. Her instinct told her
that he was merely cloaking his evil intentions in
smooth words, but she had not experience enough to
be able to strike through to the truth.</p>

<p>“Besides,” Gault went on, “if we do not get the fur
to the Crossing, Gruber will get tired of waiting for it.”</p>

<p>Loseis caught at this. “So,” she said, “you are
sending it to Gruber, then?”</p>

<p>“I expect to,” said Gault cautiously, “but I must
reserve myself full freedom of action. He has got to
satisfy me that he can dispose of it to the best advantage
of your interests.”</p>

<p>“When does it go?” asked Loseis.</p>

<p>“To-morrow morning.”</p>

<p>“By the usual route?”</p>

<p>“No. I am sending it to Fort Good Hope; and
thence by my launch to the Crossing.”</p>

<p>Loseis felt that here was a point she could stick on.
“I would rather have it go by pack train as usual,
direct to the Crossing over the prairie,” she said.</p>

<p>“That would take two weeks longer.”</p>

<p>“Just the same, I request you to send it in that
manner.”</p>

<p>“I must decline.”</p>

<p>The red flags flew in Loseis’ cheeks. “You have
said that it was my fur,” she said. “Very well, I order
you to send it out as I desire.”</p>

<p>Gault, cool and hard; frankly enjoying the spectacle
of her anger, said: “And I decline to do so.”</p>

<p>Loseis observing that she was furnishing him with
enjoyment, contrived by a miracle to control herself.
“Thank you very much,” she said coolly. “I was just
trying to find out where I stood. Shall you accompany
the consignment?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Gault darkly, “I remain here to look
after you.”</p>

<p>Loseis bowed, and marched back to her own house.
Gault looked after her, rubbing his lip. His thin
mouth was twisted with anger and bitterness. By
God! there was a spirit in the girl! Never had she
seemed so desirable to him as at that moment. Moale
too, looked after her with a deep wistfulness in his
mysterious eyes. The tang of red blood cut him off
from any hopes in that direction.</p>

<p>Loseis put her feet down like a little princess; but
her eyes were stinging with tears. She conducted an
orderly retreat, while her heart was bursting with
mortification. It was intolerable to be so proud and
so helpless. Helpless! Helpless! Her sex, her
loneliness, her ignorance delivered her three times
over into the power of this man. She was certain
now that he intended to rob her, and she could do
nothing!</p>

<p>During the whole day the preparations went on.
The pack-saddles were got out; and the fur was
divided into lots of a suitable size for a horse load.
Gault sent Moale to the Women’s House with a
polite message requesting Loseis to come to the store
to issue the necessary grub. She proudly handed over
the key, telling them to take what they required, and
leave a memorandum of it.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the horses were rounded up. As
many were put into the corral as it would hold, and
the rest picketed in the square. Upwards of seventy
horses were required for the entire outfit. To make
any sort of progress between twelve and fifteen men
would be needed to pack and unpack the horses twice
a day. Moale and two of the Crees were going, while
the other two remained to wait upon Gault. Loseis
observed that Ahchoogah, Mittahgah and others of
the Slavis who had accompanied the fur train on other
years, were working willingly enough with the horses.
This started a train of thought in her mind.</p>

<p>Gault is too strong for me, she told herself; why
shouldn’t I trick him if I can?</p>

<p>With the passing of danger, the three Slavi girls
had come sidling back into the kitchen of the Women’s
House, and Loseis indifferently took them in, partly
because she was accustomed to having them wait on
her; and partly because they furnished a useful link
with the Slavi village below. She now called Mary-Belle
to her.</p>

<p>“Can it be true,” she asked, “that Ahchoogah, Mittahgah,
and other men are going to Fort Good Hope?
That place is dangerous for Slavi men.”</p>

<p>“Wah! they would not go to that place!” said
Mary-Belle with a look of terror. “There is bad
medicine in that place! Gault has said if they will
drive the horses as far as the red spring, the water of
which makes men and horses sick and well again, he
will give each man a Stetson hat and a mouth-organ.
Blackburn never had mouth-organs in his store. The
red spring is half way between the two rivers. Gault
says for the Slavis to leave the horses there and come
home. Musqua (one of the Crees) is riding fast to
bring the Crees from Fort Good Hope. Moale and
Watusk (the other Cree) will watch the horses and
the fur at the red spring until they come. So there is
no harm.”</p>

<p>Loseis let the subject drop.</p>

<p>After supper, choosing a moment when she believed
that Gault and Moale were still at the table, she went
over to the store. Fastening the door behind her, she
climbed through the back window, and making her
way down to the creek shore, followed it down to the
Slavi village. Of course if Gault happened to look
out of the end window of his house, he could see her
amongst the Slavis; but then it would be too late to
interfere with her purpose.</p>

<p>The air was still full of a pleasant warmth, and the
Slavis having just eaten, were squatting in groups outside
the tepees, laughing and chatting in their ceremonious
way. It is only in the presence of a white
man that the Indian is taciturn. By this time the men
had thrown off the alcoholic poison which had made
them sick for days, and a general feeling of well-being
was in the air. Fathers fondled their little sons, and
abused their womenfolk; and the latter accepted it
with equanimity.</p>

<p>At the approach of Loseis a dread silence fell upon
them, and they drew a walled look over their dark
faces. It was the first time she had visited them since
that terrible night, and they expected the worst. But
Loseis was bent on playing a part to-night. Her face
was as smooth as their own, and much blander.
Allowing them to suppose that she had forgotten what
had happened, she addressed this one and that by
name with grave politeness; promised a mother medicine
for her sick child, and handed out peppermint
lozenges to the little boys who were the idols of the
tribe. Nobody would have thought of giving the little
girls candy.</p>

<p>Loseis sat down on an overturned dug-out, with the
manner of one who is prepared to hold agreeable discourse.
The Slavis began to gather round, but always
with that absurd pretense of not letting their left hands
know what their right hands were doing. Loseis was
very wonderful to them, too wonderful to inspire affection;
awe was nearer the word.</p>

<p>At first she talked of the stage of water in the river;
the promise of a full crop of berries; the scarcity of
rabbit; all subjects of first-rate importance to the
Slavis. Ahchoogah, the oldest man present, in order
to prove how bold he was, undertook to answer her
politely to her face. When Loseis perceived that she
had gathered the audience she wanted, she went on
casually:</p>

<p>“The wind is from the setting sun. There will be
no rain. It is well. The men who are going to-morrow
will see Fort Good Hope in five sleeps.”</p>

<p>A tremor of uneasiness passed through her listeners.
“No, no!” said Ahchoogah. “We are not going
to Fort Good Hope. At the red spring we will
turn back.”</p>

<p>“That is Gault’s talk,” said Loseis courteously.
“All know that Gault’s talk hides a snare. When you
get to the red spring you will not want to turn back.
Gault’s medicine will draw you on. It is very strong
medicine. It’s name is electricity. I know it, because
Gault brought me a little piece of it when he came
here. The girls at my house have told you that. It
opens its eye in the dark.”</p>

<p>Loseis paused to allow this to sink in. She fancied
that she perceived fear behind the blank masks of the
Slavis; but could not be sure. None spoke.</p>

<p>“I have heard of many strange things at Fort Good
Hope,” she went on with an air of indifference that
the Slavis could not outdo. “Men say that Gault is
Old Man’s partner. Old Man say to Gault; I lend
you my strong medicine, but when you die you must
be a dog to my sledge. Gault thinks he will cheat Old
Man, by going away to the white man’s country to
die. Maybe so. I do not know such things. I hear
them told.”</p>

<p>She paused again. The men looked down their
noses. A woman crept to Loseis’ feet, and twitched
her skirt.</p>

<p>“Loseis, tell my son not to go,” she said tremulously.</p>

<p>“If he wants to go, what is that to me?” said Loseis
with an air of surprise. “He will see strange things.
When Gault claps his hands—Wah! there is light.
Gault catches the voices of the air on his wires and
brings them into his room. He did that in my father’s
house and I made him stop, because I did not want the
Powerful Ones to fix their eyes on me! Etzooah has
told you these things. At Fort Good Hope Gault
keeps great beasts fastened to the earth. They have
fire in their bellies and they do his bidding. When
they open their mouths you can see the fire, and steam
hisses through their nostrils as from many kettles in
one. When they are hungry they scream so that a
man falls flat on the ground to hear it. These fiery
beasts eat men too, and Gault is always worried because
he has no men to spare. So he is glad when
strangers come to Fort Good Hope.”</p>

<p>Loseis rose, feeling that she could hardly better this
conclusion. She held out her hand in turn to Ahchoogah,
to Mittahgah, to Mahtsonza and the others there
that she knew were going next day. “Good-by.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Good-by. You are good hunters. You bring me
plenty of fur. I am sorry that you go.”</p>

<p>She returned home. It was impossible to tell how
the Slavis would react next day; but she had done her
best.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>Early next morning Loseis was at her window.
Nothing was changed. The horses were still picketed
in the square; and the Crees were lounging about the
doorway of the men’s house. The lordly Crees had
no notion of bestirring themselves while there were
Slavis to do the hard work. By and by Gault appeared
in the doorway, and with vigorous pantomime
of anger evidently demanded to know why nothing
had been started. He was told; whereupon Etzooah
was dispatched down to the Slavi village in a hurry.</p>

<p>From the other window Loseis watched Etzooah
haranguing the Slavis, and expostulating with them.
It was all in vain. He was finally obliged to return
cringing to Gault, shrugging, spreading out his hands
in significant by-play. Gault’s face turned black, and
he aimed a furious kick at Etzooah, that the wily redskin
dodged. Gault went inside; while Etzooah
slipped around the house. Gault reappeared carrying
an ugly quirt. Summoning his Crees with a jerk of
the head, he set off down the rise. The tall redskins
followed with cruel grins of anticipation.</p>

<p>Back at the end window, Loseis saw the miserable
little Slavis driven like sheep by the five tall men. But
sheep were never used so brutally. The sneaking Etzooah,
reappearing from the creek-bed, pointed out
the wanted ones, who were driven up the rise with incontinent
kicks and cuffs, and the furious lashing of
the whip. Squeezing their bodies together to offer as
small a mark as possible, the diminutive savages
darted this way and that, to find that they could only
escape punishment by running straight ahead. The
Crees yelled with laughter. The Slavis, cowering,
made haste to start packing the horses, and Loseis
made up her mind that she had lost.</p>

<p>Oscillating between the two windows, she presently
saw that the Slavis below were striking their tepees,
and piling everything pell-mell into the canoes, and
she took heart again. She knew the Slavis better than
Gault did. Either Gault did not notice what the
people were about, or he disdained them. There was
no interference with them. They presently set off in
a cloud up-river, paddling as if the devil were behind
them. So precipitate was their departure that a small
boy who had gone down amongst the willows to set
muskrat snares, returned to find his village wiped off
the flat. After prowling around to see if by chance
any scraps of food had been overlooked, the child set
off composedly up-river by the horse-track.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards Loseis perceived that Gault was
having trouble with his gang. In the process of saddling
the pack-horses, some of the Slavis had disappeared.
The four Crees were sent off in different
directions to round them up. This was a fatal move,
because Gault and Moale could not possibly watch all
the others, and Etzooah would always play double.
The Slavis, on their part, have an uncanny faculty of
choosing the moment when no eye is upon them to
fade away silently: to slip behind a building, to roll
down the creek bank, to lose themselves in the bush of
the hillside. In spite of Gault’s whip, and his terrible
voice, his crew literally melted away before his eyes.
After making long detours, they would rejoin their
people somewhere above. Even weakness is not without
its resources.</p>

<p>When the Crees returned empty-handed, the Slavis
were reduced to five. These were all but surrounded;
nevertheless, it was presently discovered that there
were but four, without anybody being able to say what
had become of the fifth. In any case it would have
been impossible for such a small number of men to
pack and unpack seventy horses twice a day. Gault
gave up. The remaining Slavis were dismissed with
kicks, and the trader, doubtless in a hellish rage, strode
back to his house. Near the door, the grinning
Etzooah spoke to him. For an instant Gault showed
a murderous face in Loseis’ direction; then went inside.
Loseis experienced a feeling of the sweetest
triumph.</p>

<p>However, within an hour, two of the Crees with
their bedding and grub set off on the easterly trail, and
her heart sunk again. In four or five days they would
be back with a swarm of Crees from Fort Good Hope.
What good would four days do her? She had only
succeeded in prolonging the agony.</p>

<p>Seeing the last of their people disappear, the Slavi
girls exhibited the frantic, unreasoning fear of half-broken
horses deserted by the herd. Loseis scornfully
let them go. They slipped around behind the Women’s
House, and were not seen again.</p>

<p>The pack-horses had been turned out again; and
the fur carried back into the little warehouse. The
lock of the warehouse had been forced out of respect
to Gault’s pretense that the key was sealed up in
Blackburn’s desk, and no other lock was put on. The
door was held shut by a propped pole.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Gault had not returned the key to the
store; and after waiting a few hours, Loseis sent
Mary-Lou across the square with a polite request for
it. The girl returned without it, and bearing a message
equally polite, to the effect that henceforward
Gault would relieve Miss Blackburn of the trouble of
attending upon the store. Until her duly constituted
representative arrived, he would administer it together
with the rest of her property.</p>

<p>Loseis was never the one to take this lying down.
She instantly marched over to the store. The door
was fastened with a padlock through staples. Loseis
bethought herself that there were crow-bars somewhere
about the post. However she found an easier
way. Gault had overlooked the fact that the little
back window was out. Loseis climbed through, and
obtaining a file and a new lock from the store, returned
to the front of the building and set to work. It was a
long job in her inexperienced hands; but she was supported
by the agreeable thought that Gault was watching
her. By the end of the afternoon she found herself
inside. Putting in the rear window, she fastened
the new lock, and returned to her house to supper
dangling the keys from thumb and forefinger.</p>

<p>After supper Moale came over. Loseis received
him at the outer door. Whatever his private feelings
may have been did not appear. He said in an impassive
voice:</p>

<p>“Mr. Gault instructs me to say that you and your
girl must prepare to go out to Fort Good Hope when
the fur goes in four or five days’ time. He can no
longer take the responsibility of keeping you here
while the Slavis are in open rebellion.”</p>

<p>Loseis laughed scornfully. “He can always find
respectable-sounding words, can’t he?” she said.
“You’re a white man, aren’t you? I should think you
would feel ashamed to be the carrier of such lying
words.”</p>

<p>Moale’s face changed not a muscle. Some secret
feeling made him proof against her scorn. He was
not altogether white. He had not looked directly in
her face.</p>

<p>Loseis’ temper got the better of her. “You tell
Gault, I shan’t go!” she cried.</p>

<p>In his even voice Moale said: “I am instructed to
say that Mr. Gault is prepared for that.”</p>

<p>Loseis shut the door.</p>

<p>During the hours that followed she walked up and
down her room, half beside herself with balked rage.
What possible answer was there to this latest threat
of Gault’s. He had hinted at using force. He intended
to lay hands on her. To Loseis’ flaming blood
there were only two possible answers: to kill herself or
to kill Gault. The first alternative she immediately
rejected; that was the counsel of weakness. Nothing
would please Gault better than for her to kill herself.
She would kill Gault then, before he should lay hands
on her. But ah! <span class='it'>dared</span> she take the life of a white
man? She had had so vivid an experience of death
taking a man in his strength.</p>

<p>Besides there were three other men. She could not
hope to shoot them all before she was seized. She
would be carried out anyhow. She visualized the
horrors of a trial of which she knew so little; she
imagined the cloud of lies that would beat her down.
She had no one to speak for her but Mary-Lou; and
Mary-Lou would never be allowed to speak. And if
she were, the simple red girl would be struck dumb
with terror. Disgraced! Disgraced! thought Loseis.
Parted from Conacher without hope in this life. She
buried her face in her hands. I must not kill him!
she thought in terror. I must not let myself kill him.
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But how can I help it if he lays hands on me!</p>

<p>If Gault had come over without warning to seize
her, Loseis would have snatched up a gun, and shot
him without thinking about it. But with devilish cunning
he had sent to tell her of his intention. He was
giving her four days in which to go mad with trying
to find a way out when there was none.</p>

<p>Mary-Lou was terrified by the expression on her
mistress’ face. She held out her arms imploringly.
“Please .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. please to go to bed,” she whispered.
“You will sleep. To-morrow you feel better.”</p>

<p>“Sleep!” cried Loseis. “I shall never sleep again!”</p>

<p>“Please .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. please,” persisted Mary-Lou. “Please
stop walking.”</p>

<p>“Go to bed, you,” said Loseis angrily. “Let me be
by myself. Close the door after you.”</p>

<p>Mary-Lou went sadly out.</p>

<p>Loseis pressed her knuckles against her temples. I
must be quiet! she told herself. I must think what I
am doing! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Quiet! The only thing that would
quiet me would be to go across and call him to the
door and shoot him! Ah, then I could sleep! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
must not think such things! I must not! I must always
be telling myself it would not end things to kill
him; it would only begin worse things! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But what
is the use? I know I shall suddenly kill him! If he
lays hands on me! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If I were a man he would not
dare! She flung her arms above her head. “O God!
why didn’t you make me a man! It is too hard to be a
girl!”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>It had been dark for some time. To-night the
silence was even more complete, for no child whimpered
in the tepees, and no Slavi dog barked. Loseis
was pulled up all standing by hearing a gentle tapping
on the glass of the window alongside the kitchen door.
These nights the inside shutters were always closed.
She instinctively flew to her gun which was standing in
the corner; but put it down again, smiling scornfully
at herself. It was not in this manner that an attack
would be made.</p>

<p>Returning to the window, she said firmly: “Who
is there?”</p>

<p>A whisper came winging back: “Conacher.”</p>

<p>Loseis’ heart failed her; her legs wavered under
her; she struggled to get her breath. Then in a
flash life and joy came crowding back until she felt
as if she would burst. She clapped a hand over her
mouth to hold in the rising scream of joy. Gault must
not know! “Oh, Paul! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, Paul!” she murmured,
fumbling blindly for the latch of the door.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE FUR GOES OUT</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>L</span>oseis</span> and Paul Conacher sat on the great white
bear rug before the fire. Said Loseis, concluding
her tale:</p>

<p>“He gave me to understand through Moale, that he
would stop at nothing.”</p>

<p>“The scoundrel!” muttered Conacher. “He was
trying to terrorize you. In reality he cannot touch
your rights here, unless you sign them away.”</p>

<p>“Sign?” said Loseis sharply. “I have signed my
name four times on blank sheets of paper for Gault.
I had clean forgotten that.” She described the circumstances.</p>

<p>“Obviously a trick,” said Conacher. “If you had
known anything about banking methods, you would
have seen through it.”</p>

<p>“I am so ignorant!” said Loseis humbly.</p>

<p>“How could you be expected to know!” said Conacher.
He mused. “I wonder how in thunder he expects
to use those signatures.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Were they at the
top, in the middle or at the bottom of the sheets?”</p>

<p>“Towards the bottom,” said Loseis. “He pointed
his finger, and I wrote.”</p>

<p>“Of course!” said Conacher. “Then he could fill
in anything he wanted above your signature.”</p>

<p>Loseis leaned towards him. “What does it
matter?” she said dreamily. “We are together!”</p>

<p>“You darling!”</p>

<p>Loseis was too happy to remain sitting still.
Springing up, she threw back the little shutter. Outside
it was broad day. “The day of my happiness!”
she murmured. Sticking her head through the kitchen
door, she called out: “Mary-Lou! Quick with my
breakfast. I must set off!”</p>

<p>“So soon?” said Conacher. “It’s not four.”</p>

<p>“Gault mustn’t see me start. If he tried to interfere,
you would be drawn into it, and everything
spoiled.”</p>

<p>“He’ll see you come back.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t matter. I shall have settled everything
with Tatateecha then.”</p>

<p>“Can we depend upon the Slavis?” asked Conacher
anxiously.</p>

<p>“If it was to fight, never! But to play a secret
trick at night, oh, yes! that’s just in their line.”</p>

<p>“And I?” asked Conacher.</p>

<p>“You must stay close to the house all day. This
shall be your room now .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ah! the happy room!
Do not go near the windows.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Where did you
leave your dug-out last night?”</p>

<p>“Hidden under the willows about a furlong downstream.
I thought I had better communicate with you
before showing myself.”</p>

<p>“You did right! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If the Slavis were here your
dug-out would be discovered within an hour, but Gault
will never find it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You must sleep all you can to-day.”</p>

<p>“You must sleep too.”</p>

<p>“Ah! happiness has made me over! I need no
sleep! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. However, I will be sensible. I will be
back from the lake in three or four hours, and will
sleep all day in the kitchen. Neither of us will get any
sleep to-night.”</p>

<p>“I don’t altogether like your plan,” said Conacher
frowning. “I should be the one to stay here.”</p>

<p>“You are wrong in that,” said Loseis earnestly.
“There is nothing of any value here. All Gault cares
about is the fur. The post of danger is with the fur,
and you have that.”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t you and I take it out together?”</p>

<p>“No! If I left the Post, it would give Gault an
excuse to say that I had given up my rights here.”</p>

<p>“But how can I leave you alone again?”</p>

<p>“Ah, nothing can harm me now!” cried Loseis. “I
am guarded by happiness! I will do everything quite
willingly that Gault forces me to do, and just be
patient until you and Gruber come back. There is a
sergeant of police at the Crossing. Bring him back
too. Oh, Gault will be quite different when he knows
that help is on the way. He has to think of the law,
then.”</p>

<p>Conacher was silenced: but he did not look altogether
convinced. They sat down to their breakfast.</p>

<p>“It is like being married!” said Loseis with a sigh
of content. “Mary-Lou, have you cooked enough for
a man’s breakfast?”</p>

<p>Loseis’ own horse and her saddle were in the stable
behind the men’s house; therefore unavailable. Having
improvised a halter out of a piece of rope, she
therefore set off on foot; and catching one of the
broken horses in the meadow beyond the creek, she
rode it in the Indian fashion, bareback.</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>At half-past eight she was back again. Turning the
horse loose, she hid the halter in a bush, and returned
across the stepping-stones. Gault was pacing up and
down in front of his house. From this position he
could not see her until she started to mount the rise.
It was impossible for him to tell from what direction
she had come. At sight of her, notwithstanding his
self-command, his face sharpened with curiosity; and
he changed his course in order to intercept her.
Loseis was seized with a slight sense of panic. He
must not read anything in my face! she told herself.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” said Gault, politely.</p>

<p>“Good morning,” returned Loseis. Alas! for all
her care, she could feel the dimples pressing into her
cheeks, and she knew that her eyes were shining. She
kept her lids lowered, but that in itself was a giveaway,
for she had been accustomed heretofore to look
Gault straight in the eye.</p>

<p>By the brief silence which succeeded, she knew that
his suspicions were aroused. “You are up early,” he
remarked in a carefully controlled voice.</p>

<p>“I just went down to see if the Slavis had left a
canoe that I could use,” she said carelessly.</p>

<p>“I did not see you go,” said Gault.</p>

<p>“It must have been an hour ago,” said Loseis. “I
went for a walk, the morning was so pleasant.” (I
should not be explaining things like this, she thought.
I ought to be proud and angry with him.)</p>

<p>“If you want a canoe my men will make one for
you,” said Gault.</p>

<p>“Oh, no, thank you,” said Loseis quickly. “It was
just a fancy. One must have something to do.”</p>

<p>She had not stopped walking, and they came to her
door. Loseis bowed.</p>

<p>“May I come in for a moment?” asked Gault.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” she said quickly. “We are not ready
for visitors so early. But if you wish to speak to me
here I am.”</p>

<p>“Oh, it will keep until later,” said Gault. He
touched his hat, and watched her through the door.</p>

<p>Conacher was waiting for her in the inner room.
Loseis flung herself in his arms.</p>

<p>“Ah, you are really here!” she murmured. “It was
not a dream! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. If Gault could see me now!” she
added with a laugh, like a chime of little bells.</p>

<p>Conacher pressed the hair back from her forehead.
He had been watching through the window, and his
face was dark. “It makes me see red to have that man
speak to you,” he muttered. “What was he after?”</p>

<p>“Wanted to know where I’d been?” said Loseis.
“Of course I didn’t tell him. But I’m afraid I gave
away a good deal in my face. I have him badly worried.
I hope it won’t cause him to sit up to-night, or
set a watch on us.”</p>

<p>“All is arranged then?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Tatateecha will land a hundred men in the
second river meadow at ten o’clock. They will wait
there until it becomes dark. We’ll only have about
four hours of darkness, and the moon will be shining.
It cannot be helped; we must put our trust in silence.
Slavis are the quietest animals there are.”</p>

<p>A few hours later, Loseis, sleeping in the kitchen,
was awakened by Mary-Lou who said that Gault was
coming across.</p>

<p>“He must be allowed to come in,” said Loseis. “Say
that I am sleeping. It will give me a moment to prepare.”</p>

<p>She hastened into the other room. Awakening Conacher,
she said:</p>

<p>“Gault is coming. I must let him in here in order
to put his suspicions to sleep. Get under the bed.”</p>

<p>Conacher, still bemused with sleep, obeyed her; and
Loseis, with a rapid survey of the room, gathered up
whatever was his, and thrust it after him. The robe
of raccoons’ tails hung down over the edge of the bed
concealing all. She went to the door.</p>

<p>“Come in,” she said, affecting to conceal a yawn.</p>

<p>“I am sorry to have disturbed you,” said Gault
smoothly. His eyes swept around the room, taking
everything in. It was not that he expected to find
anyone there; he was merely trying to discover what
secret source of support Loseis had found. He gave
her a hard look as much as to say: What are you
sleeping in the morning for?</p>

<p>Loseis, having had time to prepare, was fully mistress
of herself. “Last night I was too angry to
sleep,” she said coolly.</p>

<p>“Hum!” said Gault, rubbing his lip. “That is what
I came to talk to you about.”</p>

<p>Loseis held herself in polite readiness to hear what
he had to say.</p>

<p>“We mustn’t quarrel,” said Gault. He buttered his
harsh voice; but his eyes were still boring into the girl.</p>

<p>“I don’t wish to quarrel,” said Loseis mildly. “But
when you tell me you are going to banish me from my
own home .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>“You refuse to co-operate with me,” said Gault,
spreading out his hands.</p>

<p>“You don’t give me a chance,” said Loseis. Inwardly
she was quaking dangerously with laughter.
If he knew what was under the bed!</p>

<p>“You are so young!” said Gault deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“However young I am,” said Loseis, “what is mine,
is mine!”</p>

<p>“Well, I may have been a little too hasty,” said
Gault with the air of one who was making an immense
concession. “Let us try to make a fresh start.”</p>

<p>Loseis reflected that if she allowed a reconciliation
to take place she would never be able to get rid of
him. “Perhaps I have been hasty, too,” she said, “but
I can’t forgive you yet. Give me another twenty-four
hours .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Come to breakfast to-morrow, and I
promise to meet you half way.”</p>

<p>“Done!” cried Gault, showing all the big teeth. I
am wearing her down! he thought. Women do not
mean all they say! “Expect me at eight,” he said,
making for the door.</p>

<p>Conacher crawled out from under the bed with a
very red face. “It’s good he went!” he growled. “I
couldn’t have stood it much longer.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What did
you want to ask him to breakfast for?”</p>

<p>Loseis was charmed to see Conacher betraying jealousy.
“While I have him here no discovery is likely
to be made,” she said. “Every hour’s start that you
can gain will help.”</p>

<p>“Well, I hope he comes after me, that’s all,” said
Conacher grimly.</p>

<p>At ten o’clock that night Loseis and Mary-Lou
came out of their house arm in arm, and stood in
front of the door linked together, gazing up at the
serene moon. Behind them crouched Conacher.
Across the way Gault’s house was in the blackest
shadow, and they could not tell but that the door might
be standing open, and some one watching them from
within. Making out to be lost in contemplation of the
moon, the two girls, always taking care to present a
double front to a possible watcher, edged to the corner
of the house. Conacher then darted around behind.
He was to make his way around the outside of the
square and meet them beside the creek in half an hour.</p>

<p>Loseis went back to close the door of her house,
and the girls continued their stroll. From the middle
of the square they could make out that the door of
Gault’s house was closed. They descended to the bank
of the main stream, and came back again. Having
by this maneuver satisfied themselves that they were
not being followed, they returned down the rise, picked
up Conacher at the creek, and crossed the meadow
beyond. Upon the gravelly ridge which bounded it on
the other side, they came upon Tatateecha and his
silent men, squatting on the earth with their backs to
the moon like a patch of little bushes.</p>

<p>Conacher was presented to Tatateecha as the friend
of Loseis who must be obeyed in all things. Conacher
himself could only issue his orders by means of signs.
Being a white man, and therefore not to be trusted
where absolute silence was required, he was sent down
into the second meadow to wait. The little Slavis deployed
in the first meadow, and slowly closing up,
urged the horses slowly back over the ridge. In the
second meadow they could be packed without danger
of arousing the sleepers at the post. For this operation
the light of the moon would be invaluable.</p>

<p>Led by Loseis, the whole tribe then crept back in
single file through the grass towards the Post. They
crossed the creek, not by the stepping-stones, but
higher up, immediately below the steep bank at the
back of the men’s house and the little warehouse.
Leaving her men at the bottom of the bank, Loseis
went up to make a reconnaissance. She crept up to the
wall of the men’s house, and rounding the front corner,
edged, a foot at a time to the door. Laying her
ear to the crack, she was rewarded by hearing heavy
snores within. No watch was being kept. What had
Gault to fear from two girls?</p>

<p>Returning to her men, Loseis gave the signal, and
the business of the night began. Loseis herself removed
the pole that propped the warehouse door, and
let it back softly against the wall. One of the Slavis
was posted close to the men’s house with instructions
to croak like a bull-bat if there was any sound of movement
from within. Inside the warehouse Loseis would
have been thankful to use her electric torch, but was
afraid of precipitating a panic amongst the Slavis.
However the fur had all been divided into half loads
for a horse, each half load being a load for a man.
Silently the endless procession wound in and out. A
long line of little men waited in the moonlight at the
door. Nobody stumbled, or dropped his load. There
were a hundred bundles of fur. Afterwards the pack-saddles,
saddle-cloths, hitching-gear had to go. Loseis
breathed a little prayer of thankfulness when at last
she propped the pole against the closed door, exactly
as it had been before.</p>

<p>There was still the grub to be got from the store;
but as this was passed out through the rear window,
and carried away behind the warehouse, the danger
was not so great.</p>

<p>The easterly sky was full of cool light when the
hitch was thrown over the last pack, and pulled home.
The head of the train had already started. Tatateecha
rode first to make the trail. Conacher lingered to say
good-by to Loseis. His heart failed him.</p>

<p>“Ah, come too,” he urged her. “Here are plenty of
spare horses. Let me take care of you!”</p>

<p>“No, no, dearest!” she said. “Before we had gone
twenty miles Gault would be up to us, and the Slavis
would stampede. We’d have to wait for Gault’s
Crees after all. But if you can only get the Slavis
fifty or sixty miles from home into a strange country,
you couldn’t drive them away from the grub-boxes. I
am hoping that two days may pass before Gault discovers
the loss of the fur.”</p>

<p>“He will see that the horses are gone,” objected
Conacher.</p>

<p>“They are accustomed to wander from one meadow
to another along the river.”</p>

<p>The last Indian had passed out of sight. Conacher
took the girl in his arms. “You are asking the hardest
thing in the world of me,” he groaned. “And that is
to leave you!”</p>

<p>“Ah! don’t make it harder for me,” faltered Loseis.
“It is the only way!”</p>

<p>“Damn the fur!” said Conacher. “It makes me
out a mere fortune-hunter. I wish you had nothing!”</p>

<p>“I’m not worrying about what you are,” said Loseis.
“My heart tells me. For myself, I care nothing about
the fur. It was my father’s. I would feel that I had
been false to him, if I let Gault fool me out of it. I
could never respect myself. I am Blackburn’s daughter.
I cannot allow the name of Blackburn to become
a joke in the country.”</p>

<p>“I’m only a tail to the Blackburn kite,” grumbled
Conacher.</p>

<p>Loseis laughed a little, and pressed him close. “I
shall make it up to you,” she whispered. “You shall
be my lord and master. Isn’t that enough?”</p>

<p>“That makes me feel worse,” he said. “I’m not
worthy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>Loseis put a loving hand over his mouth. “Enough
of that talk,” she said. “You love me, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Until death,” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Me too, until death,” she whispered passionately.
“That makes us equal. This talk of fortunes and
worthiness is less than nothing.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Now you must
go.”</p>

<p>“They ride so slowly,” pleaded Conacher.</p>

<p>“Get on your horse, dearest; I must not be seen returning
to-day.”</p>

<p>Conacher obeyed with a heavy heart. He leaned
out of the saddle for a final embrace. They clung together.</p>

<p>“Good-by,” whispered Loseis. “Good-by, my dearest
love. Come back soon!”</p>

<p>Swiftly withdrawing herself from him, she gave his
horse a smart slap; and it carried him away.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE DISCOVERY</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>D</span>awn</span> was rosy in the East when Loseis got
home; but the moon had set, and the little square
within the buildings was full of shadows. There was
no stir of life about the men’s house; the door was still
closed. Loseis slipped thankfully within her own
door. Mary-Lou, being of no help in packing the
horses, had been sent home some hours before.</p>

<p>In her first feeling of relief, Loseis threw herself on
her bed, and was instantly asleep. But at six her subconscious
anxiety awoke her again; and the instant
she awakened, she was at the window. The door of
the men’s house now stood open; and the two tall
Crees were respectively splashing in a basin and brandishing
a towel outside the door. They had learned
this trick from the white man. Etzooah squatted on
the ground near by, grinning derisively. The Slavis
did not believe in washing. If they ever yielded to this
weakness, it was in secrecy.</p>

<p>One of the Crees went off to the stable; and presently
returned leading Gault’s own horse, a rangy,
half-bred chestnut from the “outside.” Gault appeared
from the house fully accoutered, and Loseis’
heart seemed to drop into a hole in her breast. Suppose
he rode along the river trail; any man not absolutely
blind must perceive the marks of the passage of
the fur train. However, to her relief, he trotted
diagonally across the square, and started up the trail
behind the store.</p>

<p>Freshening himself up to come courting again,
thought Loseis with curving lips.</p>

<p>Her next anxiety was that Moale, actuated by his
passion for fine furs, might visit the warehouse to look
them over. But Moale did not appear outside the
cabin. Loseis saw smoke rising from the chimney, and
supposed that he must be acting as cook for the time
being. So she left the window to prepare herself for
the day.</p>

<p>In due course Gault returned from his ride. He
went within to refurbish himself; and promptly on
the stroke of eight was to be seen striding across the
square, very stiff and handsome and black.</p>

<p>Quite a picture, thought Loseis in a detached way;
but not for my album. She spoke through the door
to Mary-Lou. “Let him wait in the kitchen for a
moment. We must not appear to be too eager.”</p>

<p>When she opened the door, Gault was standing
there, hand on hip, looking every inch the chief, and
fully aware of it. He presented a smooth face to her,
with a hard and wary eye. He did not know exactly
what to expect. Loseis, making her own face expressionless,
greeted him politely.</p>

<p>“Come in,” she said.</p>

<p>The table was ready spread in the inner room, and
they sat down to it, outvying each other in cool politeness.
Gault was thinking: She asked me here this
morning. It’s up to her to show her hand. And
Loseis was thinking: I have everything to gain by
keeping him guessing. Let him make the first move.
So it was:</p>

<p>“This fried rabbit is delicious, Miss Blackburn.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you like it. I was sorry there was no
other fresh meat. The Slavis say that a man may
starve on rabbit.”</p>

<p>“The Slavis may say so: but it satisfies me. I can
never get it cooked so well as this. It needs a woman.”</p>

<p>“But I have read that the most famous cooks are
always men.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was speaking of our country. I have had
many a good man cook on the trail; but they seem to
lose their cunning in a house.”</p>

<p>“My usual cook is the Slavi girl that I call Mary-Ann,”
said Loseis. “But she has run off with the
others.”</p>

<p>Gault shrugged in a commiserating fashion. This
was getting on dangerous ground.</p>

<p>The trader was at a serious disadvantage in this
fencing, because he wanted the girl, wanted her intolerably,
whereas she was indifferent to him. Gault
did not know the cause for it; but his senses were
aware that Loseis was revealing a new beauty these
past two days. Her dark eyes were fuller and more
beaming; her very skin seemed to radiate a mysterious
quality of light. All this made the man a little sick at
heart; but he could not altogether give up hope,
either. She asked me to breakfast, he told himself;
what does that mean but that she is beginning to come
round. Very often a woman is most scornful just at
the moment when she is preparing to give in. I should
hang off a little now.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Loseis was thinking: Five hours! They
will be making their first spell. Fifteen miles. I told
Tatateecha to cut it down to three hours on the first
day. Then five hours on the trail, and camp for the
night thirty miles from here. Gault’s Crees cannot
arrive before to-morrow night at the earliest. My
people will then have sixty miles start.</p>

<p>Loseis’ beauty teased Gault to such an extent that
he was forced to make overtures to bring a little
warmth into that composed face. “Shall I send to
the lake village to fetch Mary-Ann back?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” said Loseis. “I prefer to ignore her. I
shall be in a better position to deal with her when she
comes crawling back of her own accord.”</p>

<p>“I was merely thinking of your comfort,” said
Gault.</p>

<p>“You are very kind.”</p>

<p>Gault could no longer keep it in. “Well, am I forgiven!”
he asked in a jolly sort of way.</p>

<p>Loseis gave him no answering smile. “I am no
longer angry with you,” she said coolly. “I am just
neutral. I am waiting to see what happens.”</p>

<p>Gault was a good deal dashed. She is just playing
with me! he thought angrily. But Oh God! that pure,
pale skin, that proud averted glance! With an immense
effort he controlled himself. “There is no need
for you to leave this place,” he said with a reasonable
air.</p>

<p>Instead of showing the gratitude that he expected,
she said in a slightly surprised voice: “Of course
there isn’t!”</p>

<p>“But if we are to remain here together,” he said,
nettled, “you must make it possible for me to work
with you.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me that you are putting the cart before
the horse,” said Loseis softly.</p>

<p>Gault ground his teeth together. This child to be
taking such a tone to him! “My dear girl!” he said
loftily, “I must be the one to decide what is best for
us until some better qualified person appears.”</p>

<p>Loseis thought: I must not make him too angry. I
must lead him along. She said in a more amicable
tone: “We are just talking in a circle.”</p>

<p>Gault contrived to laugh again. “Of course we
are!” he cried. “Well, what do you propose? You
promised to meet me half way.”</p>

<p>“I will do anything that you suggest,” said Loseis
with an alluring mildness, “provided you explain the
reasons for it.”</p>

<p>The blood rushed to Gault’s pale face. He had to
restrain himself from reaching for her hand. “That
is all I could ask!” he cried.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Loseis slyly went on, “I will even go out
to Fort Good Hope when you send the fur, if it is
necessary.”</p>

<p>A doubt occurred to the trader—this was such a
violent face-about: but she looked so adorable when
she said it, that he waved the doubt away. “Splendid!”
he cried. “I now say to you that there is not
the slightest necessity for your going to Fort Good
Hope!”</p>

<p>Loseis smiled at him at last, a slow, oblique, curious
smile, having infinitely more meaning than the
trader suspected. It carried him clean off his feet.
His hand shot out.</p>

<p>“Shake!” he cried.</p>

<p>Loseis could not control the impulse of her blood
that forced her to rise suddenly (she had finished her
breakfast) and to say with cool distaste: “Oh, please
not. I hate to paw.”</p>

<p>And Gault’s blood was aware of the true significance
of that recoil, but his vanity would not acknowledge
it. He sat glowering at her half-hurt, half-angry,
a pathetic sight at fifty-three. “Oh, sorry,” he said
in a flat voice. “It is instinctive amongst men.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Loseis, trying to smooth things over.
“But I am not a man.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Do smoke one of your delicious
cigars. I have missed them during the last
few days.”</p>

<p>Gault allowed himself to be deceived. “My pet
weakness!” he said, smiling at Loseis rather killingly.</p>

<p>They were tempted outside. Loseis’ gaze involuntarily
swept the heavens. No cloud in sight; not the
filmiest of vapors to dim the inverted bowl of blue.
There would be no rain for days. It was well.</p>

<p>“What are you expecting?” asked Gault smiling.</p>

<p>“Oh, nothing!” she said with a shrug. “My father
always looked at the sky when he came out of doors.
I suppose I caught the habit from him.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Shall we
walk down to the river? Things have been so mixed
up lately, all my habits are broken up. I need exercise.”</p>

<p>“Delighted!” said Gault. “.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There is not going
to be any more quarreling, is there?” he added with
his fond smile.</p>

<p>“I hope not,” said Loseis demurely.</p>

<p>They paused at the edge of the river bank. The
view was filled in by the bold high point opposite, with
the old grave and the new grave side by side on top
within the extended palings. The sight of the grassy
mound and the earthy mound aroused a poignant emotion
in Loseis.</p>

<p>Do <span class='it'>they</span> know what I am going through? she wondered.
Ah! I hope not! I should not want their
peace to be disturbed!</p>

<p>Gault, watching the girl’s face, said with a heavy
gravity: “I have not yet had the opportunity to visit
Blackburn’s grave. I trust I may be permitted to pay
that tribute. He was a great man!”</p>

<p>Loseis turned back from the river. She did not care
to share her emotion with <span class='it'>him</span>. The hypocritical
words sickened her slightly. “Of course!” she said
coolly. “Why not?”</p>

<p>A hard nature! said Gault to himself.</p>

<p>However as they sauntered back through the grass,
which was now bestarred with pale crocuses, Loseis
exerted herself to charm him, and God knows that was
not difficult. Matters went swimmingly again. Gault
expanded. He could see himself bending elegantly
and solicitously to the slim and lovely girl. It was
a sensation one had never experienced in that rude
country.</p>

<p>As they mounted the rise to the little plateau, Gault
was saying: “I am expecting my men back to-morrow
afternoon with some fresh supplies from Good Hope.
I trust you will give me the pleasure of dining with
me. The fare will not be as good as that you provide,
but perhaps it will have an element of novelty.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>And at that moment they perceived Moale running
towards them like a madman.</p>

<p>Loseis’ heart sank. All her trouble to fool him was
for nothing, then! Immediately afterwards she went
hard all over. Now for it! Well, let it come!</p>

<p>“The fur is gone!” yelled Moale.</p>

<p>“<span class='it'>What!</span>” cried Gault, with an affronted air, that
was almost comic.</p>

<p>“The warehouse is empty!” cried Moale waving his
arms. “Gone! Gone! All gone!” Nothing else
could so have aroused that wooden man.</p>

<p>Gault and Loseis now stood at the top of the rise.
The trader turned to the girl with a towering look.
“By God!” he said, softly at first, then louder: “By
God! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. You have hidden the fur!”</p>

<p>Loseis, holding herself very straight, looked away
with a maddening air of unconcern, and held her
tongue.</p>

<p>“She has sent it out!” cried Moale. “The saddles
are gone; the horses are gone! I have sent Watusk
along the trail to pick up their tracks.”</p>

<p>“Where is the fur?” demanded Gault of Loseis.</p>

<p>She reflected that the truth was bound to come out
immediately. “I have sent it out,” she said coolly.
“It was mine.”</p>

<p>The two men stared at her open-mouthed, bereft of
speech. Finally Gault got his breath back, and his
anger.</p>

<p>“You foolish girl!” he cried. “You have lost it
then! The Slavis are useless without a leader.”</p>

<p>Loseis thought it just as well to let them know that
they had more than the Slavis to deal with. “They
have a leader,” she said with an offhand air. “My
friend Mr. Conacher is in charge of the pack-train.”
How sweet it was to flick that name so carelessly in
Gault’s rage-distorted face.</p>

<p>Another silence. Gault’s face looked perfectly witless
in its astonishment. Then it crimsoned, and the
storm broke. In his passion the man’s coarse nature
brazenly revealed itself.</p>

<p>“You lying hussy!” he cried. “All the time you’ve
been showing me your demure face, you’ve been secretly
receiving your lover! Lies! Lies! Lies!
Nothing but lies behind that smooth face! All morning
you have been lying to me to pave the way for his
escape! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>The girl faced him, surprised at first, then royal in
her anger. “How dare you!” she cried. “You accuse
me of lying, you! <span class='it'>you!</span> Why should I not lie to you?
You, whose whole presence here has been a lie since
you told me Etzooah could not speak English! You!
with your mouth full of hypocritical talk, pretending
to be my friend while you plotted to rob me! You unspeakable
blackguard! It was lucky for me that I
found a true friend!”</p>

<p>Gault’s face turned blackish; and his lips drew back
over his teeth. He raised his clenched fists over his
head as if to strike Loseis down. But the scared
Moale touched his arm, and the blow never descended.
A terrible shudder went through Gault’s frame. He
turned and strode stiffly away. At the door of his
house he curtly dismissed Moale, and went in alone.</p>

<p>Inside her own door, Loseis’ knees weakened under
her, and she was glad to sink into a chair. She covered
her face in the effort to shut out that truly frightful
picture of rage. After all she was only a girl.
Ah! how thankful she would have been to have Conacher
at her side then!</p>

<p>Her weakness was but momentary. She hastened
to the window, standing far enough back to keep her
face from showing at the pane. It was essential for
her to know what Gault was going to do. Suppose he
and his men rode after Conacher, she would have to
follow, and let the Post look after itself. Impossible
to remain inactive! Her horse was as good as the
best. Should she not ride at once to warn Conacher?
Her horse was in the stable with Gault’s horses. But
there were other horses she might catch. No! No!
First she must see what Gault was going to do.</p>

<p>The Cree, Watusk, returned, and the four men
were hanging around outside the door, at a loss what
to do. Suddenly Moale went in as if summoned by a
call. He immediately reappeared, spoke to the others,
and they all went into the corral and stable. In
due course they came out leading all of Gault’s remaining
horses, eight in number, ready saddled; some to
be ridden, others to carry packs. They began to carry
out their belongings from the house.</p>

<p>Now I must start! thought Loseis in a fever. But
a more prudent voice restrained her. You mustn’t
let Gault see what you’re going to do!</p>

<p>When the little train was ready, Gault came out of
the house. To Loseis’ astonishment he kept on across
the square. He was coming to speak to her. She began
to tremble all over. Just the same, she was glad
that she had stayed. She went to the door, and waited
for him in an unconcerned pose. He should never
guess that her heart was pounding.</p>

<p>Gault had only partly succeeded in regaining his
composure. He was lividly pale; his lips moved with
a curious stiffness; and there was an ominous triangular
furrow etched in his forehead. Without looking
directly at Loseis, he said in a controlled voice:</p>

<p>“I have done my best to look after your affairs.
You have rejected my efforts at every turn. Well, if
you have found somebody else to advise you, there is
nothing further for me to do here. I am returning to
Fort Good Hope.”</p>

<p>With that, he faced about, and went to his horse.
Loseis had not said anything at all. The others were
waiting in the saddle; and as soon as Gault mounted
they set off, Gault staring stiffly ahead of him, the
others looking askance at the girl lounging in the doorway.
Around the store, and up the side hill at the
back.</p>

<p>The instant they were out of sight Loseis sprang
into action. Without waiting for so much as coat or
hat, she ran across to the stable, and flung saddle on
her horse. It was perfectly evident to her that Gault
was still lying. If he had, as he pretended, given up in
disgust, he would have ridden away without a word.
The fact that he felt it necessary to advertise his giving
up was to her proof positive that he was not giving up
at all.</p>

<p>Mary-Lou, seeing her mistress prepare to ride away,
realized that she would be left the last living soul at
Blackburn’s Post. Panic seized her. Running across
the square, she met Loseis leading her horse out of
the stable.</p>

<p>“Take me! Take me!” she gasped.</p>

<p>Loseis was obliged to curb her headlong desire to be
off. “Well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” she said impatiently.
“The buckskin is in the stable. I will saddle him for
you. Run back to the house. Fetch some grub.
Shove my riding clothes in a saddlebag. I’ll change
on the trail.”</p>

<p>As she tightened girths, Loseis reflected: Etzooah
is familiar with the triangle of country between the
two trails, from having trapped it in the winter.
There is no cross trail, but it would be possible to lead
their horses through the bush, and across the coulee.
Take a little time, though. I shall be on the southerly
trail ahead of them.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But suppose they steal back
here first to spy on me .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?</p>

<p>A hard little smile wreathed Loseis’ lips. Hastily
tying the horses to the corral fence, she flew across the
grass again. Meeting Mary-Lou coming out of the
house, she ordered her to put down the things, and
help her. In the house, Loseis tore the mattress off
her bed, and dragging it into the kitchen ripped it open.
It was stuffed with moss. Wetting the moss from the
barrel of water which stood within the door, she arranged
it in the fireplace in such a way that it would
smolder a little at a time.</p>

<p>“That will last out the day,” she said smiling.
“Come on; let’s go!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span><h1>CHAPTER XV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>SHADOWING</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>L</span>oseis</span> and Mary-Lou rode hard through the
river-meadows and over the gravelly ridges.
There was no danger that anyone who followed would
be able to pick out the prints of their horses’ hoofs
in the confusion of tracks left by the fur train. When
they gained the shelter of the wooded country, some
six miles from the Post, Loseis pulled up to a walk.
It is impossible to think at a gallop. She wished to
canvass all the possibilities of the situation again.</p>

<p>She thought: The further they went along the trail
before striking across, the harder it would be to get
over. Therefore if they intended to come this way
they would turn off as soon as possible. They would
now be behind me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But I do not <span class='it'>know</span> that Gault
intends to ride after the fur, though that is the likeliest
thing for him to do. How foolish I would look if
I dashed ahead to warn Conacher, and then Gault
never came. Gault might be planning to steal back to
the Post, and seize it. Or he might have some devilish
trick in mind that would never occur to me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I
will not ride on until I make sure that he is on this
trail.</p>

<p>It is impossible to hide with horses alongside a
traveled trail. The horses are certain to betray you
by whinnying at the approach of other horses.
Therefore, Loseis was obliged to ride on four miles
further to the Slavi village at the foot of the lake.
Here she sent Mary-Lou across the river with instructions
to turn the horses out, and to lose herself
amongst the Slavis.</p>

<p>Loseis walked back along the wooded trail, looking
for a suitable place of concealment. The river ran
close alongside. On the river there was a fringe of
berry bushes at the base of the trees; but the water
sparkled through the interstices of the stems. No
room to hide there. The other side was more open; a
thick brown carpet of pine needles that smothered all
undergrowth. Loseis began to run in feverish impatience.
Suppose she was surprised before she could
hide herself.</p>

<p>At last in a place where the sun broke through, she
came upon a thick clump of the high-bush cranberry
on the inshore side of the trail. She walked up and
down the trail surveying it from every angle. It would
serve! She crept in, careful to leave no tell-tale marks
of her passage. She constructed herself a little cave
amongst the leaves, that would permit of a certain
freedom of movement without betraying her by a
rustle. Here she crouched within two yards of the
trail.</p>

<p>It was very difficult to compose her impatient blood
to wait. The swollen river moved down, whispering
and sucking under the bank. Overhead a smooth,
smoky-colored whisky-jack fluttered like a shadow
from branch to branch, cocking a suspicious eye down
at her. Would he betray her? thought Loseis
anxiously. However he made up his mind after awhile
that she was a fixture, and faded away. In the distance
Loseis could hear the children and the dogs of
the Slavi village. A dozen times within a quarter hour
Loseis looked at her watch; and each time put it to
her ear to make sure it had not stopped.</p>

<p>A whole hour passed, and another one on top of
that. Loseis was beginning to ask herself if she were
not on a fool’s errand. What ought she to do? What
ought she to do? Then she heard a sound that caused
all uncertainty to vanish: hoof-beats on the hard-packed
trail. It was then two o’clock. As the sound
drew closer her brow knitted; only one horse; that was
not what she had expected; why should they send one
man in pursuit of Conacher?</p>

<p>A minute later Etzooah rode by in the trail. He
was not hurrying himself at all; his horse was single-footing
it gently; and the Indian rode with his near leg
thrown over the saddle horn, his body all relaxed and
shaking in the untidy native style. Etzooah, unaware
of being observed, looked thoroughly well pleased with
himself. He hummed a chant under his breath, and
from force of habit his beady black eyes watched on
every side of him. Sharp as they were they perceived
nothing amiss in the clump of high-bush cranberry.</p>

<p>When he had passed, Loseis after making sure that
there were no more coming, issued out of her hiding
place, and started back for her horse, considering.
Her first impulse was to ride after Etzooah, but she
dismissed it with a shake of the head. No! No personal
danger threatened Conacher from Etzooah’s
coming. This was just part of some tricky game that
Gault was playing. Etzooah might safely be left to
Conacher to handle. She must find out what Gault
was about. There lay the real danger.</p>

<p>Obtaining her horse, and bidding Mary-Lou to remain
where she was, Loseis rode back towards the
post. Having ridden about two miles, an intuition
warned her to dismount and lead her horse, that she
might not give undue warning of her passage. Shortly
afterwards the mare suddenly threw up her head and
whickered. A moment later Loseis heard more hoof-beats;
several horses this time, pounding in a measured
way that suggested they were being ridden by men.</p>

<p>Turning her horse, Loseis mounted and rode back
a hundred yards or so to a small stream that fell into
the river. Dismounting in the water, she cut her mare
sharply across the withers, sending her galloping on
in the direction of the Indian village. Wading up the
little stream, she presently climbed the bank, and making
a detour among the pines, pressed herself close in
to the stem of a young tree, with branches growing
down to the ground. It was not a perfect hiding-place;
she was further from the trail.</p>

<p>The riders approached. They were walking their
horses now. Gault, Moale and one of the Crees; the
other, Watusk, was missing. They had left their pack-horses
behind them. So they are not going far!
thought Loseis. Gault’s face, when he was alone
with his men, wore an expression that he had never
permitted Loseis to see; a look of naked brutality that
made the girl shiver. It is the natural expression of
that face, she thought.</p>

<p>Even before she could see their faces, Loseis heard
Gault and Moale talking back and forth. The first
words she heard distinctly were spoken by Gault. He
said:</p>

<p>“It must have been somewhere along here. I heard
a horse run off along the trail. I had not heard it before
that. Sounded like some one might have been
waiting here.”</p>

<p>“A loose horse startled away by our coming,” suggested
Moale. “There are plenty of them along the
river.”</p>

<p>“They don’t often run alone,” Gault pointed out.</p>

<p>“A Slavi, then. I suspect they prowl up and down
this trail.”</p>

<p>“We don’t want them prowling around us,” growled
the trader.</p>

<p>“Let Musqua cry like the Weh-ti-go,” said Moale.</p>

<p>The Cree, grinning, threw back his head and uttered
the long-drawn, wailing screech that is supposed to be
the cry of that dreadful spirit.</p>

<p>“They will say that it is Blackburn,” said Moale
chuckling.</p>

<p>There was a silence.</p>

<p>“We mustn’t go too far,” said Gault. “Or we’ll be
on top of the Slavi village.”</p>

<p>“What are you looking for?” asked Moale.</p>

<p>“A dead tree alongside the trail that we can pull
over.”</p>

<p>For some reason these words struck a cold fear into
Loseis’ breast. The riders passed out of earshot.</p>

<p>The trail wound in and out among the trunks as
woodland trails do, and you could never see more
than twenty-five yards or so ahead or behind. As
soon as the men had gone, Loseis issued from her
hiding-place, and started to follow on foot. She could
still hear the murmur of their voices but not what they
said. The leisureliness of their progress puzzled her.
They were not going much further. What could they
be up to? And the remaining Cree; what had become
of him?</p>

<p>She heard them pass through the little stream that
crossed the trail. A short distance beyond they
stopped, apparently for the purpose of holding a consultation.
Loseis approached as close as she dared,
but could not make out their words. After awhile
they left the trail. From the sounds that reached her,
Loseis understood that they were leading their horses
away amongst the trees. She went forward as far as
the stream, and ascended the bed of it, thus keeping
roughly parallel with the course they were taking.</p>

<p>For a couple of hundred yards back from the river,
the forest was perfectly flat, and for the most part
clear of undergrowth. The ground then rose steeply,
and on the hillside young trees and bushes crowded
up. The little stream came down through a ravine
full of bowlders. Loseis, concentrating on the faculty
of hearing, gathered that men and horses had made
their way back to the foot of the rise, where they had
gone into camp for a spell.</p>

<p>She climbed up the side of the ravine to a point
well above their heads, and then edged cautiously
around the hill until she was directly over the voices.
Thereupon she began to let herself down softly, softly,
an inch at a time, choosing every foothold with circumspection,
snaking her body through the bushes with
care not to create the slightest rustling. Loseis as a
child had not played with the Slavi children for nothing.</p>

<p>She discovered at last that they had established
themselves at the base of a gigantic bowlder embedded
in the side of the hill. The smoke of their little fire
was rising over the top. Loseis, descending from
above, worked her body by slow degrees out on top of
the bowlder, where she lay perfectly hidden, about fifteen
feet above their heads. It would have been too
risky to attempt to peep over the edge of the stone,
but whether she could see them was immaterial to her,
so she could hear.</p>

<p>Her cautious progress around the hillside had consumed
a good bit of time, and when she arrived above
the camp it was still. For a long time she could hear
nothing but the uneasy nosing of the horses, that had
no forage in that spot. They must have been tied,
for they did not move about. Loseis knew the men
were still below her, for she detected a faint aroma of
tobacco, apart from the fumes of burning pine. At
last, startlingly, Gault’s quiet voice resolved itself
out of the stillness. He might have been speaking to
herself.</p>

<p>“No, don’t put any more on. If any of the Slavis
happen to be traveling up on the bench, the smoke
would attract them. Just keep it going until we’re
ready to eat.”</p>

<p>Moale asked: “When will you eat?”</p>

<p>Gault replied: “We can only eat once. Put it off
until evening.”</p>

<p>Then silence again. Loseis feared that that which
she so desired to hear must already have been talked
out between them.</p>

<p>By and by she heard a horse single-footing it rapidly
in the trail.</p>

<p>“Here comes Watusk,” said Moale.</p>

<p>From the sounds which succeeded Loseis made out
that Musqua had been stationed alongside the trail to
intercept Watusk. They could presently be heard approaching
with the horse, through the trees below.
As soon as they were within speaking distance Gault
said sharply:</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>A voice, presumably Watusk’s, replied: “Blackburn’s
daughter, and the Beaver girl are at the post.”</p>

<p>The listening Loseis smiled to herself.</p>

<p>“Did you see them?” asked Gault.</p>

<p>“N’moya. They were in the house. How could
I look in the house without showing myself? There
was smoke coming out of the chimney. For an hour
I watched it from the branches of a pine tree where
the trail goes over the hill.”</p>

<p>“Maybe Blackburn’s daughter had left the Indian
behind.”</p>

<p>“N’moya.”</p>

<p>“Watusk is right,” put in Moale’s voice. “After
everybody else was gone, no Indian would stay there
alone; not with that new-made grave in sight!”</p>

<p>“It is well,” grumbled Gault.</p>

<p>There was more talk about eating. Gault indifferently
told the breeds they could take theirs if they
wanted, but they would get no more until morning.</p>

<p>More time passed. As is always the case with men
waiting an event, they found but little to say to each
other. Sometimes the Crees discussed their own concerns
in low tones. Sometimes they all fell silent for
so long that Loseis supposed they had fallen asleep.
Then suddenly Gault and Moale took up the thread of
a conversation as if it had been dropped but a moment
before.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we hang a noose in the trail?” asked
Moale.</p>

<p>“No way of keeping a noose spread,” returned
Gault. “It’s better to stretch the tracking line across
the trail from tree to tree at such a height that it will
catch him under the chin. I hope it breaks his damn
neck. Most likely though, it will only yank him off
his horse.”</p>

<p>Loseis’ blood slowly congealed as she listened.
There could be no doubt who the “him” was that they
referred to.</p>

<p>“Then we’ll jump on him,” Gault went on; “and tie
him up, and lay him in the trail, and pull the tree over.
I’ve got it all figured out. The branches of that tree
will stick out over the edge of the bank, consequently
the trunk will lie flat on the ground and break his
back.”</p>

<p>“It may not kill him outright,” suggested Moale.</p>

<p>Loseis heard a horrible chuckle. Gault said: “Oh,
I’ll stick around until he dies. I don’t care if he lingers
a bit. I hope he’ll have sense enough to take in what
I’ve got to tell him. If he lingers too long I’ll stop
his breath. You fellows can ride on. I’ve got the best
horse. I’ll overtake you. We’ll all have to ride like
hell to get to Fort Good Hope in time to establish a
proper alibi.”</p>

<p>There was a brief silence, then:</p>

<p>“But there won’t be any trouble. Unless he’s found
to-morrow, the coyotes and the wolverines will have
picked him clean. And in any case the fallen tree, the
broken back will tell their own tale. I’ll recover the
letter, of course, before I leave him.”</p>

<p>“Hadn’t we better keep a watch alongside the
trail?” Moale asked uneasily.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“He might come along before dark?”</p>

<p>“Impossible. I told Etzooah after he had located
the camp, not to show himself until the position of the
sun showed eight o’clock. You can trust a Slavi to
keep cover. If Conacher jumped on his horse that
minute and ran him the whole way he couldn’t get
back here till near midnight.”</p>

<p>At last they had named their intended victim!</p>

<p>“My only fear is that it may be daylight before he
gets here,” said Gault. “But of course we’ll get him
anyhow.”</p>

<p>“He may suspect a trick, and not come at all.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sure!” said Gault unconcernedly. “But we
had a damn persuasive argument to use. If he don’t
come by daylight we’ll go after him.”</p>

<p>“And afterwards,” said Moale, “what you going to
do afterwards?”</p>

<p>Again the chuckle! “By and by I’ll ride back to
Blackburn’s Post to resume my courtship.”</p>

<p>“She’ll be mourning for the other one then.”</p>

<p>“What of it? It wouldn’t be the first time that a
woman consoled herself with the next best thing. It’s
a very good time to tackle a woman. She’s tender
then.”</p>

<p>Loseis had heard enough. She commenced to work
herself backward off the rock. She inched her way up
hill in the same manner that she had come down. She
was doubly careful now, for another life beside her
own depended on her success. When she had got
high enough to be out of earshot, she turned in the
other direction from that she had come, and making a
wide detour, regained the trail a good furlong beyond
Gault’s camp, and set off to recover her horse.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>WITH CONACHER</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>C</span>onacher’s</span> spirits rose somewhat with the sun.
It was impossible for a healthy man to be altogether
miserable under that tender, beaming sky. The
lovely, changing prospects of the parklike country
through which Blackburn’s River flowed, made the
heart swell. Conacher loved, and was loved in return.
An apparition of the exquisite Loseis continually swam
before his eyes. He was anxious; but he kept saying
to himself as a civilized man will: Oh well, nothing
serious can happen nowadays.</p>

<p>In the more open places, it was thrilling to see the
long, laden train of horses stretching ahead; winding
over a ridge; trotting down into the bottoms. The
imagination was arrested by the thought of the riches
stored in that endless succession of brown packs. It
was like a picture to illustrate an old fairy tale.
Thoughts of Aladdin and Sindbad flitted through the
young man’s mind. Riches!—not represented by a
trifling row of figures in a book, but visibly spread
before his eyes. Come to think of it, Aladdin married
a princess, too. An insipid miss in bloomers according
to the pictures; nothing like the darkly vivid Loseis!</p>

<p>Among other directions for the journey, Loseis
had warned Conacher not to allow the Slavis to cross
the river to loiter in their village. It occurred to the
young man that he would not be able to prevent this
while he brought up the tail of the procession, so he
took advantage of one of the river meadows to urge
his horse to the head of the line. By Tatateecha’s
crestfallen look at his approach, he judged that he
had acted rightly. It was his first good look at the
rotund, greasy little head man of the Slavis. Tatateecha
was better favored than the run of the Slavis;
but that was not saying much. He had a neat, Buster
Brown hair-cut, and a red fillet bound around his brow.</p>

<p>Tatateecha edged his horse out of the line, and fell
back to consult with the next man. They were like
a pair of children conspiring together, with sharp,
calculating glances at Conacher. The white man affected
not to notice them. Presently Tatateecha came
back to him all smiles. Conacher had had no experiences
of the Slavis, but he knew something about the
Indian nature in general. He’s going to try to put
something over on me now, he thought.</p>

<p>Tatateecha by means of animated signs conveyed
to Conacher that his village lay a short way ahead;
and that it would be the best place to spell. Splendid
grass for the horses.</p>

<p>“Not on your life!” said Conacher, with vigorous
pantomime of denial. He indicated to Tatateecha
that there would be no spell until the sun had traveled
a space equal to two hours.</p>

<p>The Slavi broke into speech; but Conacher had
him at a disadvantage there, by not understanding a
word of it. The white man continued to point to the
sun. Tatateecha became aggrieved; almost tearful
in his protestations. Then, bringing his horse close to
Conacher’s he signified with a winning air, that he himself
was perfectly willing to go further; but the rest
of the men would refuse to go at all, unless they were
permitted to say good-by to their families. Conacher
replied by signs that if they refused to go and fetch
the grub and ammunition, when the snow covered the
ground there would be no grub, no meat, and the
people would starve. This argument was unanswerable,
and Tatateecha fell back sulking.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards the village hove in sight across
the river. The people lined up on the edge of the
bank yelling; and Conacher’s men yelled back. All
knew that the white man could not understand their
tongue; and Conacher guessed that they were making
pretty free with him. It was a trying situation; but
he preserved his imperturbable air.</p>

<p>The river issued out of the lake by means of a
wide, shallow, brawling rapid. At the present high
stage of water, there was but one possible place to
ford, and this could not be managed even on horseback
without danger of a wetting. At the point where the
trail forked, Conacher backed his horse into the arm
which ran down the bank, and held him there blocking
the way. The Slavis jabbered angrily from one
to another; the whole train was brought to a stand.</p>

<p>Tatateecha approached Conacher to expostulate.
The white man pointed with his whip down the main
trail. Tatateecha attempting to speak again, Conacher
suddenly urged his horse forward, and cutting
the Indian’s horse smartly across the flank, sent him
careering down the main trail, the only way that was
open. The train got in motion again. The other
Slavis, seeing that Conacher meant what he said, filed
past him sullenly. The people across the river fell
silent. Conacher fell in at the tail of the procession
again. Ten minutes later his feather-headed Slavis
were singing and chaffing each other in the best temper
imaginable.</p>

<p>But Conacher had to keep a sharp look-out for deserters.
Time and again, one or another of the Slavis
edged his horse in among the trees with the object
of circling around and gaining the trail behind Conacher.
The white man found that he could best defeat
this maneuver by falling back a quarter of a mile. In
that position he would come face to face with the astonished
deserter, who thought he had already eluded
him. Caught in the act, they made no attempt to resist
his commanding voice. When they spelled at last,
Conacher, without appearing to, anxiously counted
his men. He had lost one. With dinner in prospect
there was no danger of their making off. As soon as
they had eaten he distributed plugs of tobacco.</p>

<p>Upon reaching the lake the trail turned sharp to
the eastward for some miles. In order to provide a
firm footing it had to encircle the edge of the wooded
country, far back from the water. The vast lake
meadows at this season were like a saturated sponge
underfoot. For three sleeps, Tatateecha explained,
they would be traveling alongside these meadows; and
then, climbing through a pass in the hills, would come
to the prairie, where they would find the buffalo grass
which made horses fat. This bottom grass filled them
up, but did not stick to their ribs. Tatateecha was
very ingenious in the sign language. When they
spelled he was perfectly good-humored again; attaching
himself to Conacher like a friendly child.</p>

<p>For two full hours they allowed the horses to feed,
before rounding them up again. Conacher would
dearly have liked to sleep (as all the Slavis did) but
dared not. However, because of the tobacco he had
handed out, or because they were getting too far away
from home, or for some other reason, the Slavis appeared
to have reconciled themselves. There were
no further attempts to desert. It was impossible to
tell what was going on inside their skulls.</p>

<p>Then for five hours longer they continued on their
way. The character of the route never changed. For
mile after mile the brown ribbon of earth threaded in
and out amongst the trunks of the pines, climbing the
little unevenness of ground; crossing small water-courses.
On their left hand the vast sea of grass was
generally in sight through the trees, with a suggestion
of water on the horizon; sometimes for considerable
distances the trail followed the actual line between
grass and timber.</p>

<p>At about six o’clock they halted for the night. It
seemed a pity not to take advantage of the four remaining
hours of daylight; but when Conacher looked
at the grass-fed horses, sweaty and drooping, he perceived
the necessity for camping. The horses were
turned out in the grass; the Slavis built their fire at
the foot of the bank; while Conacher spread his bed
on top in a grove of pines running out to a point,
whence he could survey both horses and men.</p>

<p>He spent the early part of the evening fraternizing
with his men amidst great laughter when, as frequently
happened, the language of signs broke down.
About eight o’clock he retired to his own little fire
above, and rolled up in a blanket. The sun had not
yet sunk out of sight; but it was planned to start at
four next morning. As he lay there day-dreaming, he
was greatly astonished to see a Slavi Indian quietly approaching
between the trees at the back of the point.</p>

<p>He sat up. All the Slavis looked very much alike
to him; but he instantly recognized that this was not
one of those who had accompanied him all day.
There was a suggestion of secrecy in his approach.
A rather better physical specimen than the average
Slavi, his face bore the childish, deceitful grin that
was characteristic of them all. His teeth were blackened
and broken; on the whole, an unpleasant-looking
individual. He held out an envelope towards Conacher;
and the young man leaped to his feet full of a
vague alarm.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he asked involuntarily.</p>

<p>The Indian, grinning, shook his head like a dog,
and pointed to his ear; the usual sign for not understanding.</p>

<p>Conacher pointed to himself, and said “Conacher.”
He then pointed to the Indian.</p>

<p>“Saltahta,” said the man.</p>

<p>Conacher took the envelope. It bore no superscription.
Tearing it open, his heart was filled with
warmth at the sight of Loseis’ signature in big round
characters. The letter had been written on the typewriter
in the stammering style of the beginner. Conacher
had had such a letter from Loseis down river.
This one was brief.</p>

<p>“There is something wrong here. Gault is plotting
mischief. I am afraid. The man who takes this to
you is a good man. Let him go with the outfit, and
you come back to me.”</p>

<p>As he read, all Conacher’s warmth was chilled.
Suspicion leaped into his mind full-grown. There was
a vagueness about the letter that was not like Loseis.
Moreover he doubted if she would ever confess to being
afraid, even if she were afraid. And why should
she sign her full name; Laurentia Blackburn. On the
other letter it had been simply Laurentia. He remembered
the sheets that Gault had made her sign
for him, and smiled to himself. Really, the plot was
too transparent. He, Conacher, was to be drawn off,
and the fur diverted to Gault’s uses under guidance of
this Indian. Loseis had told him of a Slavi who was
in Gault’s pay.</p>

<p>Suddenly putting his finger on the man’s breast,
Conacher said: “Etzooah.”</p>

<p>The Slavi looked at him with perfect, stupid blankness,
and shook his head. “Saltahta,” he repeated.</p>

<p>“Tatateecha!” called Conacher.</p>

<p>The little head man came climbing up the bank.
Whatever his astonishment at the sight of the newcomer,
nothing showed in his face.</p>

<p>“Who is this man?” demanded Conacher, putting
his finger on the Slavi.</p>

<p>“Saltahta,” said the newcomer quickly.</p>

<p>“Saltahta,” repeated Tatateecha like a parrot.</p>

<p>Conacher bit his lip. With a jerk of his head he
dismissed Tatateecha. The other man made as if to
follow.</p>

<p>“You stay where you are!” cried Conacher.</p>

<p>Whether or not the man understood English, the
gesture which accompanied the words was amply significant,
and he stopped in his tracks. He began to
whine pitifully in his own tongue, pointing to his lips
and hugging his stomach.</p>

<p>“I don’t give a damn how hungry you are,” said
Conacher. “I mean to keep you under my eye until
I decide what to do.”</p>

<p>The Indian sat down at the foot of a tree, and
pathetically exhibited his empty pipe to the white man.
Conacher tossed him the remainder of a plug of
tobacco, which he began to shave with an air of philosophic
indifference.</p>

<p>There was an agonizing struggle going on in Conacher’s
breast. Though he had every reason in the
world to believe that letter a trick, he found that he
<span class='it'>could not disregard it</span>. There was still one chance
in a thousand that it was genuine, and it was a chance
he could not take. He had been unwilling enough in
the first place to leave Loseis; this little doubt tipped
the scale. With that doubt of her safety in his mind
he recognized that it would be simply impossible for
him to go on day after day always putting a greater
distance between them. “Oh, to hell with the fur!”
he said to himself; and in that moment his mind was
made up.</p>

<p>But he had no notion of swallowing Gault’s bait (if
such it was) whole. He lit a pipe to stimulate his
mental processes, and puffed at it leaning against a
tree, and gazing down at the innocent-eyed Indian
speculatively. He thought: I shall take you back with
me, my man. Tatateecha is a good way from home
now, and he’s been over this route many times. He
ought to be able to deliver the fur to Gruber. But in
any case I’d sooner trust him than you. Whether you
like it or not, you shall come back with me.</p>

<p>It seemed important to Conacher not to allow the
newcomer to communicate with the other Slavis. Removing
the handkerchief from about his neck, he
therefore forced the astonished Indian to put his
hands around the tree behind him, and firmly bound
his wrists together. The captive loudly and plaintively
protested; it was clear that things were not
turning out in the way that he expected.</p>

<p>Conacher then went down the bank to consult with
Tatateecha. None of the Slavis had rolled up for the
night. Their faces were perfectly wooden; but the
white man sensed a certain strain in the atmosphere.
Evidently Tatateecha had told them of the newcomer’s
arrival, and it had excited them. As well as
he could, Conacher signified to the head man that he
was going back to Blackburn’s Post; and that he
wanted two of the least tired horses to be
caught.</p>

<p>Pointing up to the top of the bank, Tatateecha
asked an eager question.</p>

<p>“He goes with me,” said Conacher, illustrating
with signs.</p>

<p>He thought he saw a look of relief appear in the
Slavi faces. However they volunteered no information.
Again he asked Tatateecha the man’s name, and
received the same answer: “Saltahta.” Strange creatures!
Apparently they knew of no way of dealing
with the strong and terrifying white man except to
hide as much as possible from them.</p>

<p>Men were sent away to catch the required horses,
and Conacher took out pencil and note-book to write
his letter to Gruber. He wished to do this in the
sight of Tatateecha, knowing what a superstitious
reverence all the remoter tribes have for the act of
writing. And it was quite true that Tatateecha, out
of the corners of his eyes, followed every move of the
pencil with a look of uneasy awe. Conacher wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Hector Blackburn was killed on June 3rd by falling
over a cliff with his horse. Matthew Gault has
come to Blackburn’s Post where he is trying to take
advantage of the helpless situation of Blackburn’s
daughter. She has written to you, but supposes that
the letter has not been allowed to go through. We
are sending you the fur in charge of Tatateecha because
we have nobody else. If you get this letter send
us help quickly. Send the police if possible; at any
rate send white men. I have promised Tatateecha a
credit of one hundred skins if he places this letter in
your hands.”</p>

<p>“Paul Conacher, Dominion Geological Survey.”</p>

</div>

<p>Conacher inclosed this letter in the torn envelope,
since he had no other, and offered it to Tatateecha.
The Indian received it gingerly and wrapped it in a
fold of the gay worsted sash he wore. Conacher
explained whom it was for, and told Tatateecha he
should receive goods to the value of a hundred skins
when it was delivered. To convey the figure, the
white man patiently broke up tiny twigs to the required
number. Tatateecha’s eyes widened in delighted
cupidity. In that moment he could be depended
on; the question was, could his feather-head
hold to a resolution long enough to carry it through?</p>

<p>The two horses were driven up on top of the bank.
The Slavis jeered and pointed at the predicament of
the one who called himself Saltahta. If it had been
Tatateecha or Conacher himself, they would have
done just the same. By Conacher’s orders, they
offered to feed the captive, but he refused it. When
his horse, which was found tied to a tree near by, was
led in, it was discovered that he had plenty of bread
and meat tied to his saddle.</p>

<p>Saddle and bridle were transferred to one of the
fresher horses, and the man was bidden to mount.
His hands were tied behind him; and his feet tied with
a loose thong under the horse’s belly. The Slavis
yelled in derision, and slapped their thighs. Conacher
would have given a good deal to have understood the
epithets they bestowed on the prisoner. A leading
rein was improvised out of a piece of tracking line.
Tying blanket and food to his own saddle, Conacher
mounted, and rode off leading the other horse.</p>

<p>For a long time he could hear the laughter of the
Slavis. He wondered if they could make any more of
the situation than he could, or if their laughter was as
meaningless as it sounded. In the hands of these
crack-brained savages, he bitterly reflected, rested not
only the fate of that fortune in skins, but also the
hope of Loseis and him receiving help from the outside
world.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE MEETING</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>hree</span> hours later the two horses were still jogging
in the same manner along the forest trail.
In the beginning the prisoner had sought to make as
much trouble as possible by beating his heels against
his horse’s ribs, rendering the animal almost unmanageable.
Conacher had then put him in front, telling
him to beat away, whereupon the Slavi had become
very quiet. The tiring horse hung back more and
more, and in order to make any progress at all, Conacher
had been obliged to take the lead, and pull the
other after.</p>

<p>The moon was now high. Little moonlight penetrated
through the trees, but the general brightness
made traveling easier. A slow trot was the best that
Conacher could get out of the horses. Even that
pace was not without danger at night. Had not the
trail been freshly cleaned up that day for the passage
of the fur train, they could not have done it.</p>

<p>Conacher figured that he was within two or three
miles of the Slavi village. In two hours more he
would make Blackburn’s Post. His heart leaped at
the thought of rousing Loseis up in the middle of the
night. How astonished she would be! He would
hold her in his arms again! He urged his horse forward,
and gave the leading rein a jerk.</p>

<p>Not but what he had certain doubts, too, of his reception.
Loseis might blame him for returning;
would want to send him away again perhaps. Conacher
firmly shook his head in the darkness. No!
whatever the truth of the situation, it was better for
them to remain together. Nothing should persuade
him to leave her again.</p>

<p>As Conacher, dreaming, jogged along between the
half-seen pillars of the pines rising into obscurity, his
wearied horse threw up his head and whinnied. The
rider instinctively drew up to listen. A sound of fear
broke from the man behind. Presently, out of the
stillness of the forest came a faint, answering whinny
from ahead. Clapping heels to his horse, Conacher
rode to meet it.</p>

<p>The Slavi moaned in fear. “Stop!” he said.
“It is not good. There is nobody here.”</p>

<p>“Ha!” said Conacher. “You have found your English,
eh?” He continued to urge his horse forward.</p>

<p>They turned into a natural avenue through the trees
where the moonlight came flooding down. At the end
of this glade, seen first as a dim gray ghost, and gradually
resolving itself into the lineaments of life, they
perceived a motionless horse and rider blocking the
trail. For a second, such a sight in that awful solitude
caused even Conacher’s heart to fail; but he did
not pull up. As for the Indian, a strangled squall of
terror escaped him, and he fell to gibbering incoherently.
He was perfectly helpless. Tied as he was,
he could not throw himself off his horse without the
certainty of being trampled.</p>

<p>Drawing closer, a wild, joyous suspicion sprang up
in Conacher’s breast; then certainty. It was Loseis
in her boy’s dress, sitting astride the sorrel mare.
Flinging themselves off their horses, they flew to each
other’s arms, careless of the on-looker.</p>

<p>“Loseis, my darling!” murmured Conacher.
“What are you doing here?”</p>

<p>She was all woman then. “Oh, Paul .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh,
Paul .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. !” she faltered. “I came to warn you.
Gault is waiting in the trail to kill you!”</p>

<p>“To kill me!” he echoed amazed.</p>

<p>A hasty, confused explanation took place. They lowered
their voices that the Indian might not overhear.</p>

<p>“I did not send you that letter,” said Loseis.</p>

<p>“I know it.”</p>

<p>“Why did you come back then?”</p>

<p>“I <span class='it'>had</span> to come.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Do you blame me?”</p>

<p>“No! No! It is all right. If you had not come
they would have ridden after you. I can best take
care of you here.”</p>

<p>Conacher laughed half in delight, half sorely.
“You take care of me! I like that! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How did
you know they had sent me a letter?”</p>

<p>“I crept up to them in the woods. I listened.” She
gave him the gist of what she had overheard.</p>

<p>“Good God!” cried Conacher in his simplicity.
“Think of anybody wanting to kill <span class='it'>me</span>!” Catching
hold of the leading line, he jerked the Indian into the
full moonlight. “Who is this man?” he said.</p>

<p>“Etzooah,” said Loseis with half a glance.</p>

<p>“I thought so,” said Conacher grimly. “According
to the letter he was to have gone with the outfit; but
I thought I had better bring him with me.”</p>

<p>“You did well,” said Loseis.</p>

<p>Tying the horses to trees, they walked away a little
in the trail. For awhile they were completely filled
with the joy of being together again. The difficulties
ahead had to wait.</p>

<p>“Oh, my darling, when I realized that it was you,
my heart nearly burst with joy. It was so unexpected,
so lovely to find you waiting quietly in the moonlight!”</p>

<p>“Oh, Paul, it makes up for everything to have
known you! I don’t care what happens now.”</p>

<p>“You must have been waiting here alone for hours.
How could you dare to do it?”</p>

<p>“Why .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I had to do it. I never thought twice
about it.”</p>

<p>“You are the bravest girl in the world!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! I’m just an ordinary girl who is in love
with you.”</p>

<p>“I don’t deserve it!” he murmured.</p>

<p>“Well .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. neither do I!”</p>

<p>When they returned to earth, Conacher said simply:
“What shall I do with this Indian now? Put a bullet
through his head?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! no!” said Loseis nervously. “There must
be no killing.”</p>

<p>“They started it,” said Conacher.</p>

<p>“I wanted to kill Gault myself,” said Loseis
quaintly; “but I struggled against it.”</p>

<p>Conacher laughed. “Little fire-eater!” he said,
hugging her close.</p>

<p>“We must be serious now,” she said pushing him
away.</p>

<p>“I’ll have to turn the man loose then,” said Conacher.
“And let him find his way to his friends on
foot.”</p>

<p>“That will be best,” said Loseis. “They are waiting
about four miles from here. It will give us time
to get out of the way.”</p>

<p>“The horses are so tired,” exclaimed Conacher.
“And it must be eighteen miles to the fur-camp. They
will die under us before we get there.”</p>

<p>“But we are not going there,” said Loseis. “If I
had meant that, I would have ridden right through.”</p>

<p>“Where else can we go?” said Conacher, opening
his eyes.</p>

<p>“Gault and his men would be up with us almost as
soon as we broke camp in the morning. The Slavis
would run away. How could we protect ourselves
there in the open? Neither you nor I would ever be
seen alive again. How easy for Gault to explain that
there had been an accident. There would be no witnesses
but his men.”</p>

<p>“What do you propose then?” said Conacher
gravely.</p>

<p>“I have been thinking about it all these hours. We
will go back to Blackburn’s Post. There we will be
on our own ground. There are strong buildings to
protect us, and plenty of grub and ammunition. It
would be more difficult for Gault to make out that
there had been an accident there.”</p>

<p>“Right!” said Conacher. “You have a head on
you! Whatever happens we will never be parted
again.”</p>

<p>“Never!” she said going to his arms.</p>

<p>“One of us will not be left!”</p>

<p>“I swear it!” she said kissing him.</p>

<p>Conacher felt the strength of ten men coursing
through his veins. “Come on!” he said briskly.
“How do you propose to get by the men waiting in the
trail?”</p>

<p>“We will take a canoe at the Slavi village. Mary-Lou
is waiting there. She will stick to us. She is not
brave, but her heart is true.”</p>

<p>“Good!” said Conacher. “Now for this red-skinned
blackguard. How about taking him with us
to the Post? Gault would then ride after the fur at
daybreak and we’d gain a day.”</p>

<p>“What good would that do us?” said Loseis. “He
would be back at the Post by night. And in the meantime
the Slavis would be scattered. Tatateecha is our
best hope of getting help from the outside.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Conacher. “But it goes against
the grain to turn the scoundrel loose.”</p>

<p>Taking out his knife, he proceeded to cut the cringing
Indian’s bonds. “You filthy wretch!” he cried;
“you mangy, verminous coyote! If you got your
deserts I would be sticking this knife between your
ribs! Go back to your master and tell him .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>“Wait!” cried Loseis. “Not a word! Gault won’t
know how much we know. Let him guess!”</p>

<p>Conacher swallowed his anger. Etzooah slipped
from his horse, and crawled on the ground like a
whipped cur.</p>

<p>Loseis and Conacher mounted and rode on, driving
the third horse in front of them. Etzooah, cramped
from his long confinement in bonds, staggered along
slowly behind them.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span><h1>CHAPTER XVIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>CONFUSION</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>W</span>hen</span> he came to the Slavi village after his long
walk, Etzooah crossed the ford, and sticking his
head inside the first tepee, awakened the sleepers with
a yell. He demanded to know if Yellow-Head and
Blackburn’s daughter had been seen. A grumbling
voice replied that they had taken a canoe and gone
down river. Searching for a horse, Etzooah perceived
that the whites in their haste had turned out
their horses without unsaddling them. The sorrel
mare eluded him; she disliked the Indian smell; but
he caught the horse he had already ridden so far. It
would serve for the short distance he had still to go.
Refording the river, he proceeded along the trail.</p>

<p>It was not Gault’s habit to confide in his creatures
any further than he was forced to. Etzooah’s job
had been to steer the fur train east across the prairie
and hit the big river at Fisher Point, where the fur
could be picked up later by the launch and a scow
from Good Hope. Etzooah might have guessed that
a short shrift was waiting for Conacher at Blackburn’s
Post, but he had been told nothing of the details
of the plot, which, indeed, had been concocted
after his departure. Etzooah expected to find Gault
and his men camped within a mile or so of the Post,
where he had left them earlier that day.</p>

<p>Ere he had gone two miles beyond the Slavi village,
the miserable Indian rode fairly into the trap set for
the white man. He was pounding along at a good
rate over this well-traveled part of the trail, one knee
hooked around the horn of his saddle, as was his
custom. The thin line, stretched as taut as a wire
across the trail, caught him under the chin, and lifted
his body clear of the saddle. His knee held him; the
horse reared; Etzooah’s head was dragged back between
his shoulders. As the horse’s forefeet dropped
back to the ground, there was a horrible soft crack
heard. The man’s body came away from the saddle,
and dropped limply in the trail. The terrified horse
ran on.</p>

<p>There was a loud laugh of bravado amongst the
trees. Gault stepped out into the trail. “Worked like
a charm!” he said. “I think his neck is broke.”</p>

<p>Moale dropped to one knee beside the huddled
body, and struck a match. “God! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It’s Etzooah!”
he gasped.</p>

<p>“Etzooah! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Etzooah .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. !” said Gault stupidly.</p>

<p>The match had dropped from Moale’s nerveless
fingers. He fumbled with another. At last the little
flame sprang up. “Look!” he said. “Look!”</p>

<p>“God Almighty!” cried Gault. “What’s he doing
back here?”</p>

<p>Moale was feeling under the man’s head. “He’ll
never tell you,” he said grimly. “His neck is broke.”</p>

<p>Gault said anxiously: “See if he has the letter on
him.”</p>

<p>A search revealed that the letter was gone.</p>

<p>“Then he has been to Conacher,” said Gault.
“Drag him into the bush, and we’ll go get that white
man.”</p>

<p>“If his body should be found .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” suggested
Moale. “Hadn’t we better drop the tree on him as
planned for the other?”</p>

<p>“Hell! I’m not going to waste that trick on a redskin!
I may want it later. Pitch him in the river.
The current will carry him far beyond the sight of
mankind.”</p>

<p>But as Moale started to obey, Gault changed his
mind again. “Wait,” he said. “I’ll help you to hoist
his body out of way of the coyotes. Conacher was the
last man who saw Etzooah alive, understand? We
will use that later.”</p>

<p>The Indian’s body, still warm, was hung over two
spruce branches. The Crees were summoned to fetch
the horses from their hiding-place, and Gault and his
three men rode south.</p>

<p>It was full day and the Slavis were packing the
horses, in the spongy meadow, when the four big men
rode violently down the little pine-clad point. Instantly
the Slavis jumped on horses and scattered far
and wide in the sea of grass.</p>

<p>Gault had his eye on Tatateecha. “Let them go,”
he shouted to his men. He caught the plump headman
by the collar as he was climbing on a horse, and
flung him in the grass. “Now then!” he said with an
oath. “Where’s the white man?” It was a simple
matter to signify Conacher’s curling yellow hair and
blue eyes.</p>

<p>Another discomfiture awaited the furious trader.
Tatateecha, delighted to find that Conacher, and not
himself, was the object of Gault’s wrath, gave, in
signs, a graphic and perfectly truthful account of how
Etzooah had arrived the night before and had given
Conacher a letter; and how Conacher after reading
the letter had put Etzooah on a horse tied hand and
foot and had ridden back, leading him. Tatateecha
said nothing about the letter Conacher had given him,
which was burning a hole in his stomach at that
moment.</p>

<p>Gault swore violently, and Tatateecha edged out of
reach of his boot. The trader was forced to apply to
Moale in his perplexity. “What do you make of it?”
he said. “Etzooah was not tied up when we found
him?”</p>

<p>Moale shrugged. “One thing is clear,” he said,
“We’ve passed Conacher somewhere.”</p>

<p>“Then catch fresh horses and we’ll ride back!”
shouted Gault.</p>

<p>“The fur? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” suggested Moale, casting desirous
eyes on the scattered bales.</p>

<p>“To hell with the fur! I’m going to get that white
man first!”</p>

<p>At six o’clock in the morning they were back at the
Slavi village. Splashing through the ford, the first
native they came upon was a bent crone, too old to get
out of the way. Out of her dim eyes she looked at
Gault with indifferent scorn. In reply to the usual
question about the white man with the curling hair the
color of the sun, she told in signs that he had ridden
there in the night when the paleness of the sky was in
the north (midnight). Etzooah was not with him
then. The white man turned out his horse, took a
canoe, and paddled down river.</p>

<p>“Gone back to the girl,” growled Gault. “But
what in hell could have warned him that we were laying
for him in the trail!”</p>

<p>Moale suddenly perceived the well-known sorrel
mare grazing amongst the other horses. She was still
saddled and bridled. The eyes almost started out of
his head. “Look!” he cried pointing.</p>

<p>It was one of the nastiest shocks that Gault had
received. He stared at the animal with hanging jaw.
“How did that mare get here?” he demanded
hoarsely.</p>

<p>The old woman replied by signs that Loseis had
come with Conacher in the night.</p>

<p>“What!” shouted Gault. “<span class='it'>What!</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Why in
hell didn’t you say so before?”</p>

<p>The very old woman looked at him calmly. Her
glance said: You didn’t ask me!</p>

<p>The furious Gault was incapable of dealing with
her. Moale, calmer and warier, plied her for further
information. She described how Loseis had been up
and down in the trail all day. Loseis must have seen
Etzooah pass at midday, but she had not come back
to the village for her horse until near evening.</p>

<p>“Then in God’s name what was she doing all afternoon?”
muttered Gault, a certain fear striking into his
rage.</p>

<p>Nothing further was to be learned here. The four
men rode on in the direction of Blackburn’s Post.
Moale and the two Crees gave their master a good
dozen yards’ lead in the trail. The passions of hell
were working in the trader’s black face. Moale was
gray and the Indians yellowish with fatigue and apprehension.
It was a safe guess that all three would
have been glad then to get out of this ugly business;
but they were bound to their master a hundred times
over; there was no possibility of dissociating their fortunes
from his. They were not bothered by moral
scruples; but they feared that Gault’s passions had
mastered him to such an extent that he was no longer
capable of listening to the counsels of prudence.</p>

<p>At a point about a mile short from the Post, they
turned out of the trail, and followed the summit of
one of the gravelly ridges, picking their way slowly
through the scrub. Soon the timber and brush became
too thick for them to guide their horses through, and
they were obliged to dismount and lead them. After
a mile and a half of the roughest sort of going, which
included the crossing of a gorge-like coulee, they came
out on the trail to Fort Good Hope in a little prairie
dotted with clumps of poplars. Here they had left
their outfit the day before, and had turned out their
remaining horses hobbled.</p>

<p>They cooked and ate a meal in sullen silence. Afterwards
Gault dispatched Moale into the Post to spy
out the situation.</p>

<p>“Tell her,” he said with stiff and bitter lips, “that
I couldn’t rest for thinking of her alone there, and
I sent back to ask if she was all right.”</p>

<p>Moale, in his impassive way, set off without expressing
any opinion as to the usefulness of this errand.</p>

<p>He was back by the time the sun had completed a
quarter of its journey across the sky. Gault was sitting
hunched up in the grass almost precisely as he had
left him. In twenty-four hours the trader had not
slept. He sprang up at the sight of Moale.</p>

<p>“Well?” he demanded with cruel eagerness.</p>

<p>“I found the two girls in the Women’s House .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”
Moale began.</p>

<p>“Alone?” snarled Gault.</p>

<p>“Alone. Everything looked as usual. When I delivered
your message, Loseis listened politely, but her
eyes were full of hard laughter. She did not believe
me.”</p>

<p>“What did she say?”</p>

<p>“She told me to thank you, and to tell you that there
was nothing she required.”</p>

<p>“What then?”</p>

<p>“Conacher, having seen me come, came hurrying
across from the men’s house.”</p>

<p>“Without concealment?”</p>

<p>“Why should there be any concealment? They cannot
know that Etzooah is dead. They think Etzooah
has told us all.”</p>

<p>“Damnation!” muttered the trader. “I am all in
the dark! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Go on!”</p>

<p>“Conacher had a gun over his arm.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>“A gun?” echoed Gault in angry alarm.</p>

<p>“A gun. I did not have any talk with Conacher.
He left it to the girl.”</p>

<p>“What else did she say?”</p>

<p>“She asked me where we were camped. I replied
that we had made but a short stage yesterday, because
you were anxious about her. It amused her to hear
me lie. She didn’t say anything; but only looked at
the three-bar brand on my horse’s flank.”</p>

<p>Gault broke out in furious cursing. “You fool!
Why didn’t you change to one of the horses we left
here?”</p>

<p>“Those horses are not broke for riding.”</p>

<p>“You could have managed.”</p>

<p>“What difference does it make?” said Moale impassively.
“They know all.”</p>

<p>“How <span class='it'>can</span> they know?” cried Gault. “Go on!”</p>

<p>“I told her that we had come upon a bunch of her
horses, and I had borrowed one to ride back, so I
could save my own. She knew I was lying, of course.
Her horses do not range on this side of the coulee.
But she said nothing. She asked me politely if I would
eat before riding back. I had just eaten, but I said
I would, thinking I might learn something by staying.”</p>

<p>“The Beaver girl served me in the kitchen. While
I was eating Loseis and Conacher were talking together
outside the house. They talked low, but my
ears are very sharp. I caught enough of the words
to be able to piece together the sense of the whole.
Conacher wanted to tell me everything, and try to win
me to their side. I heard him say: ‘Insane with jealousy.’
He meant you. His idea was that there was no
reason why I should risk my neck for you. But the
girl would not agree. She said you had only sent me
over there to get information, and if they told me anything
it would be playing right into your hand. So
nothing was told me. When I had eaten, some more
polite speeches were made, and I rode away.”</p>

<p>“You think .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?” said Gault, knitting his brows.</p>

<p>“I am sure that they know all,” said Moale. “The
girl must have been skulking in the woods yesterday
afternoon. She has doubtless learned the Slavi
tricks of hiding and moving softly. The way Conacher
snatched up his gun shows what they expect of
us.”</p>

<p>Gault revealed the big teeth in an ugly smile. “Well
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.” he said slowly, “we won’t disappoint them.
We’re in so deep now, we’ve got to go the whole
way.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>“You mean .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?” asked Moale with his enigmatic
eyes fixed intently on Gault’s face.</p>

<p>Gault nodded somberly. “The girl <span class='it'>and</span> the man,”
he said. “Before anybody comes in.”</p>

<p>Moale shrugged acquiescently.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span><h1>CHAPTER XIX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>PREPARING FOR DANGER</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>s</span> soon as Moale rode away Loseis, Conacher and
Mary-Lou held a council. The sense of common
danger drew them very close together; their hearts
were soft towards each other. The whites treated the
Indian girl exactly as one of themselves. But poor
Mary-Lou was not of much help to them. Terror had
her in its grip again.</p>

<p>The sunshine drew them outside the door of the
Women’s House. Loseis cast her eyes about the
scene. “Ah! how beautiful the world is!” she murmured.
“Only men spoil it!”</p>

<p>“Cheer up!” said Conacher stoutly. “They haven’t
got us yet!”</p>

<p>“I do not mind danger!” said Loseis quickly. “But
such wickedness hurts my breast. It spoils life!”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Conacher. “You cannot believe in
it.”</p>

<p>“Well, never mind our feelings,” said Loseis with
a shake of her black mane. “What have we got to
expect now?”</p>

<p>“We’ve got the time it will take Moale to ride to
his master and report,” said Conacher.</p>

<p>“But he’s waiting close by, of course,” said Loseis.
“He may even be watching us from the top of the
hill.”</p>

<p>“The simplest thing would be for Gault to ride
down and break in the door with an ax,” said Conacher.
“If he does, I’ll blow the top of his head off,”
he added grimly.</p>

<p>Loseis shook her head. “Gault never does the
simple thing.”</p>

<p>“He may lose his head.”</p>

<p>“Moale is there to remind him to be cautious.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
No! Gault will never attack us in the open. Not
while we stick together. I feel that from the inside.
He doesn’t care what you would think; but he is too
conceited to let me <span class='it'>see</span> what a beast he can be.”</p>

<p>“When it came to the final point,” said Conacher,
“I don’t believe he could harm you.”</p>

<p>“He’s <span class='it'>got</span> to kill me now,” said Loseis simply. “I
know too much.”</p>

<p>Conacher walked around the Women’s House,
studying it. When he returned he said: “I think we
had better make this our fortress. There are no
windows in the back; it will be the easiest building to
defend. And more comfortable for you girls. I’ll
bring over my bed and bunk in the kitchen. You two
take the inner room.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That is, if you agree.”</p>

<p>“You are the captain,” said Loseis with a warm
glance.</p>

<p>“Well, we won’t quarrel over who’s the boss,” said
Conacher. “Our first job must be to stock up with
food, water, ammunition and firewood.”</p>

<p>They scattered to these tasks, glad to have something
to occupy their hands. Expecting momentarily
to be interrupted, they worked hard and swiftly,
always keeping their ears sharpened for hoof-beats on
the trail. But there were no alarms. Midday came;
they finished their work; and Blackburn’s Post still
basked undisturbed in the sunshine.</p>

<p>While Mary-Lou cooked the dinner, Conacher took
stock of their supplies. There was ample food, firewood
and ammunition—they had taken care to transfer
the entire stock of ammunition from the store;
but the water supply gave him cause for anxiety. The
entire stock of vessels capable of holding water consisted
of three small kegs, half a dozen pails and some
small pots. The Slavis carried water in birch-bark
receptacles.</p>

<p>“Barely a week’s supply,” said Conacher ruefully.</p>

<p>“If the worst comes to the worst we’ll have to cut
out washing,” said Loseis smiling. “The Slavis get
along without washing.”</p>

<p>After dinner they lounged in front of the house
again. This was the hardest time to put in. The uncertainty
of what to expect kept them keyed up to a
painful pitch. Conacher wished to creep up to the
top of the hill to reconnoiter; but Loseis would not
hear of it.</p>

<p>“Would you take me with you?” she asked.</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>“No, of course not!” said Loseis. “You know very
well we might walk smack into a trap.”</p>

<p>They endlessly discussed their chances.</p>

<p>“If Tatateecha makes thirty miles again to-day,”
said Conacher; “that will complete one-fifth of the
whole distance.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>“Better not count too much on Tatateecha,” warned
Loseis. “He is as reliable as water.”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Conacher. “But there’s no harm in
figuring.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Say he makes the warehouse in eight
more days. If Gruber started back instantly—and of
course he would on getting my letter; he could make
the return journey in five days, or even four if he had
plenty of horses. In twelve days then, we may begin
to look for relief. After all twelve days is not so
much.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>“But Gault will be counting those twelve days, too,”
said Loseis in a low tone. “He will not let them pass
without acting.”</p>

<p>Seeing how the Indian girl’s head was hanging
down, and her face twitching, Loseis said kindly:
“Mary-Lou, why don’t you take a horse, and ride to
the Slavi village? You can stay with the other Marys.
You would be quite safe there. And you can’t do us
any good by staying here.”</p>

<p>Mary-Lou, without looking up, slowly shook her
head. “I not like live in tepee,” she murmured.
“Please, I want stay with you.”</p>

<p>Loseis gave her a hug. “Surely!” she said. “But
I hate to see you so broken up.”</p>

<p>“I all right,” said Mary-Lou in a strangled voice.
She hastened into the house.</p>

<p>Conacher and Loseis came together. They walked
in the grass with linked arms.</p>

<p>“Sweetheart,” murmured Conacher; “you hide it
well, but you are suffering too!”</p>

<p>“You mustn’t feel sorry for me,” said Loseis, “or
I’ll feel sorry for myself then.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It’s only not
knowing what to expect! When I see what I have to
do, I’ll be all right.”</p>

<p>“If I could only get you away from it all!”</p>

<p>“I have been through it alone,” said Loseis. “Now
I have you!”</p>

<p>Later in the afternoon Conacher was sitting by himself
at the door, still revolving their chances of receiving
help from the outside, when suddenly he perceived
a bark canoe with two figures in it coming down
the river.</p>

<p>“By God! here’s something to break the suspense!”
he cried, leaping up.</p>

<p>Loseis ran to the door. But when she saw the
canoe her face showed no relief nor gladness. She
suspected who was in it.</p>

<p>And when the canoe landed in the creek mouth,
presently an all-too-familiar little rotund figure rose
over the top of the bank.</p>

<p>“Tatateecha,” said Loseis in a listless voice.</p>

<p>Conacher’s face fell like a child’s. He groaned
aloud in his anger and disappointment. “Oh, the
miserable cur!” he cried.</p>

<p>“What would you expect of a Slavi?” said Loseis,
shrugging.</p>

<p>They waited for him in a bitter silence. Tatateecha
came plodding up the grassy rise with the air
of a guilty schoolboy. His companion remained in the
canoe. Reaching the top, Tatateecha, with an absurd
pretense of not seeing Conacher and Loseis, headed
straight across towards the store. Loseis summoned
him peremptorily. He came like a dog to get his
whipping, twisting his body, and grinning in sickening
fear. Still trying to make out that nothing was the
matter, he said something to Loseis that caused her
to laugh a single bitter note.</p>

<p>“What is it?” demanded Conacher.</p>

<p>“He is out of tobacco,” said Loseis.</p>

<p>“Oh, my God!” cried Conacher. “Tobacco!
When we were counting on him to bring us help!”</p>

<p>Loseis held up a restraining hand. “You will only
frighten him stupid,” she said. “Let me find out
what happened.”</p>

<p>The miserable Tatateecha told his story to Loseis,
who translated it for Conacher. “He says, early this
morning when they were packing up for the start,
Gault, and his three big men suddenly rode into their
camp, and the Slavis jumped on horses and spread in
every direction. Gault, when he found you were gone,
turned right back, but Tatateecha couldn’t round up
the Slavis by himself, he says. One by one they gained
the trail and galloped home; and there was nothing
for it but for him to come home too.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It may be
true. It has the sound of truth.”</p>

<p>“Leaving all the fur and the pack-horses where they
were, I suppose,” said Conacher.</p>

<p>Loseis shrugged. “I expect that was bound to be
lost,” she said.</p>

<p>“And he calls himself their head man .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. !”</p>

<p>Loseis concealed her bitter disappointment under a
mask of indifference. “He isn’t worth swearing at,”
she said. “Give him a plug of tobacco, and let him
go.”</p>

<p>Tatateecha began to argue for two plugs of
tobacco; Conacher with a threatening gesture, sent
him flying down the hill.</p>

<p>Supper time was approaching when all further uncertainty
was put to an end by the sound of many
hoofs pounding down the trail above the Post. Loseis
and Conacher prudently retired within the house, and
barring the door, each took up a position at one of
the little windows looking out on the square. Mary-Lou
declined to come to the window. Conacher was
in the kitchen; Loseis in her room, and the door open
between. Conacher opened his window. Between
his feet rested the butt of his express rifle; and he
grasped the barrel in one hand.</p>

<p>Presently a numerous cavalcade rode into the grassy
square. It seemed to the watchers as if they would
never stop coming. Besides Gault and Moale they
counted sixteen well-mounted Indians; big, able-looking
fellows; mostly having a claim to a distant
white ancestor in all probability. There were also
several laden horses, and a number of spare ones.</p>

<p>“He’s brought his army against us!” said Conacher
with scornful laughter.</p>

<p>“They don’t know what they’re going to be used
for,” answered Loseis.</p>

<p>“Might be a good thing for me to tell them,” suggested
Conacher.</p>

<p>“Useless,” said Loseis. “There’s never been any
police stationed at Fort Good Hope, and they can conceive
of no authority higher than Gault’s.”</p>

<p>Reining in, Gault pointed down to the river flat
where the Slavi village had lately stood. The Indians
rode on down the grassy rise with their pack-horses
and spares; and began forthwith to make camp.
Gault and Moale were left sitting their horses side
by side. Gault, well aware that he was being watched,
never looked towards the Women’s House. To all
appearances he was as ever, the elegant gentleman;
perfectly turned out; his face smooth and bland. He
had allowed the rein to fall on his horse’s neck. One
hand rested on his hip; and with the other he gesticulated
gracefully towards the camp below, as he
issued his instructions to the deferential Moale.</p>

<p>“Quite the beau ideal,” said Loseis dryly at her
little window.</p>

<p>“So that’s my would-be murderer!” said Conacher
at his. “Gives you a funny feeling to set eyes on him
when you know.”</p>

<p>Moale dismounted and went to the door of the
Men’s House, where he knocked.</p>

<p>“Feeling his way,” said Conacher.</p>

<p>“It will be amusing to hear what excuse he gives
for coming back here,” said Loseis.</p>

<p>Conacher raised his gun. “Loseis,” he said soberly,
“the quickest way to end this matter would be for me
to shoot him off his horse as he sits there.”</p>

<p>Loseis ran to his side. “No, Paul, no!” she cried
agitatedly.</p>

<p>“It would be the best way,” he insisted. “He
means to kill us if he can. Suppose he gets one of us
and the other is left. I’m a pretty good shot. I could
get him easily now. It would end it. These other
men have nothing against us.”</p>

<p>“No! No! No!” she cried. “Not until he attacks
us! I couldn’t bear it!”</p>

<p>Conacher allowed the butt of his gun to thump on
the floor again. “Very well,” he said a little sullenly.
“Still, I think it would be the best way.”</p>

<p>Receiving no answer at the door of the men’s
house, Moale faced about, and came towards them.
Conacher and Loseis watched him with heads close together.
Moale’s comely olive face was, as always,
perfectly expressionless.</p>

<p>“What sort of man is this?” asked Conacher grimly.</p>

<p>“Who can tell?” said Loseis. “He is neither white
nor red.”</p>

<p>They opened the door, and stood side by side within
the frame to receive him, Conacher with his gun
across his arm. At sight of the gun Moale’s eyes
narrowed, but he made no reference to it in speech.
Bowing to Loseis, he said in his gentle voice:</p>

<p>“Mr. Gault wishes to know if he may speak with
you?”</p>

<p>“But why not?” said Loseis coolly. “Speech is
free.”</p>

<p>“If he comes unarmed,” added Conacher grimly.</p>

<p>Moale stabbed him with a lightning glance of his
strange eyes, but did not speak. Bowing to Loseis
again, he turned and went back to Gault.</p>

<p>Loseis and Conacher remained standing in the doorway.
The girl said earnestly:</p>

<p>“Paul dear, when he comes, you must hold your
anger in.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to truckle to him,” said Conacher,
angry already.</p>

<p>“Of course not! If we showed fear we would be
lost. But if we become angry they will use it as an
excuse to attack us, and we will be lost, too. We must
show neither fear nor anger, but only coldness. My
heart tells me that.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re right, of course,” groaned Conacher;
“but you’re asking almost too much of flesh and
blood!”</p>

<p>After a brief colloquy with Moale, Gault dismounted,
and came striding towards them with measured
steps. He had retained the lordly air of the old-time
trader. His self-control was marvelous; he kept
his head up, and looked from Loseis to Conacher with
brazen coolness. But there was a sort of glassy guard
over his eyes. You could not see into them.</p>

<p>“He has his nerve with him,” grumbled Conacher
in unwilling admiration. “Marching up to the gun
like this, with empty hands.”</p>

<p>“He may have a pistol,” suggested Loseis.</p>

<p>“He’d have to draw it,” said Conacher coolly.
“And my gun is in my hands.”</p>

<p>As he drew close, Gault’s eyes flickered once. It
must have been like a knife in his breast to see Conacher
and Loseis pressed together companionably in
the door of their house like a little family. But this
was the only sign of feeling he gave.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” he said to Loseis.</p>

<p>“Good evening,” returned Loseis.</p>

<p>Gault went on: “I was somewhat surprised to learn
from Moale, when he returned to me to-day, that Conacher
was with you.”</p>

<p>“Were you?” said Loseis dryly.</p>

<p>“You told me that he had gone with the fur.”</p>

<p>This was too much for Conacher’s honest simplicity.
“You know damned well what brought me back!” he
cried.</p>

<p>Loseis laid a restraining hand on his arm. Gault
continued to look at Loseis as if Conacher had not
spoken. There was a silence which seemed to bristle
with pointing knives.</p>

<p>“Of course it was clear to me that the Slavis would
never be able to carry through alone,” Gault resumed.
“And as I happened to meet the men I had sent for
from Fort Good Hope just then, I turned around and
brought them back with me, to offer them to you to
take out your fur. They are experienced and intelligent
men, and can travel anywhere.”</p>

<p>Loseis took thought before answering. Why does
he trouble to give me all this palaver when he knows
he has only to go and get the fur? It occurred to her
that candor on her part would be the best means of
disconcerting him. She said coolly:</p>

<p>“The Slavis have already returned. The fur has
been abandoned at the spot about thirty miles from
here, where you saw it early this morning.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>Gault changed color slightly. He could not guess
how she had learned this so soon.</p>

<p>“Well, there it lies,” Loseis went on. “I do not
mean to give you permission to go and get it. On the
other hand I cannot prevent you from doing so.”</p>

<p>Gault appeared to be debating the question with
himself. He finally said: “It is clearly my duty to
save this valuable property. I shall therefore send the
Crees after it to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“As you will,” said Loseis.</p>

<p>Gault made to go; and then turned back as if struck
by a new thought. “I shall be returning to my own
post,” he said. “My first thought was to send Moale
out with the fur; but your situation cannot be very
comfortable here. If you and Conacher would like
to accompany the fur train, Moale may remain here
to guard your property until you return.”</p>

<p>Loseis smiled coldly. So this was what he had been
leading up to!</p>

<p>Conacher’s blue eyes widened with indignation.
“Well, I’ll be damned!” he cried. “If this
doesn’t.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>Loseis touched him warningly. “I thank you,” she
said to Gault with hard sweetness. “Mr. Conacher
and I both thank you. We offer you all the thanks
that is due to your most generous offer. But <span class='it'>under
the circumstances</span>, we prefer to remain here.”</p>

<p>Gault’s face was like a wall. He bowed to Loseis,
and left them.</p>

<p>“By God .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. !” began Conacher.</p>

<p>“Hush!” said Loseis. “Anger just gives him an
opening to get angry too. But coldness mixes him all
up.”</p>

<p>“What a fool he must be to think .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>“He is not a fool,” interrupted Loseis. “He knew
exactly what he was doing. You see he was not sure
if we knew that he meant murder. His object was
to find that out. Well, he did find out.”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span><h1>CHAPTER XX<br/> <span class='sub-head'>BESIEGED</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>A</span> little</span> tent of pale green silk, trim and elegant,
was pitched for Gault in the meadow
below, a short distance from the big fire built by the
Crees. After supper they could see Gault seated in
the place of honor beside the fire, surrounded by his
men. Apparently all was peace and good-fellowship
in that camp. The attitudes of the men suggested
story-telling, and hearty laughter.</p>

<p>“This is for our benefit,” said Loseis with a scornful
smile.</p>

<p>“I shall watch through the night,” said Conacher.</p>

<p>“There will be no open attack.”</p>

<p>“Just the same, I’ll stay up.”</p>

<p>“I will take turns with you.”</p>

<p>However, Gault presently crept under his little
tent; and the Crees one by one rolled up in their
blankets, and lay completely covered up in the redskin
manner like a long row of corpses along the edge of
the creek bank. The sun went down, and the great
silence crept like long fingers out of the darkening sky.
The brief hours of darkness passed, and there was no
suspicious move nor sound from below. The last of
the sunset glow stole around the northern horizon towards
the east. In due course the sun rose again, and
the camp below lay exactly as before.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards a great bustle began. They built
up the fire, breakfasted, caught their horses, and
packed up. Moale and the main body of the Crees
crossed the creek, and galloped away over the trail to
the south. Gault and two men rode up the rise,
crossed the little square without a glance towards the
Women’s House, and went on up the trail behind the
store.</p>

<p>“There are four men unaccounted for,” said Loseis
suddenly. “Only ten went with Moale. I counted
them.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go out and take a look about,” said Conacher.
“Whatever they are plotting, it will take them
a certain time to organize it. For a few minutes anyhow,
we will be safe.”</p>

<p>They left Mary-Lou, gray with terror, alone in the
house. Conacher took his gun. After their night-long
vigil it was a delight to get out into the open. Running
down the grassy rise together, they joked at
danger.</p>

<p>“Funny, here in my own place to be expecting to
hear a bullet sing past my ears,” said Loseis.</p>

<p>“ ’S all right if it sings past,” said Conacher, grinning.</p>

<p>As soon as Loseis looked over the creek bank she
said: “There was a damaged dug-out lying in the mud
here. They have repaired it and gone in it. They
must have gone down river, close under the bank. We
should have seen them if they had gone up. I don’t
know why they should go down river.”</p>

<p>“I think I can explain that,” said Conacher.
“There are three possible ways of escape from this
place; south by the trail to the lake and beyond; east
by the trail to Fort Good Hope; and north down the
river. All three ways are now watched by our enemies.”</p>

<p>“I never should have thought of going down river,”
said Loseis. “There is nothing there.”</p>

<p>“I have thought of it,” said Conacher. “It would
be many hundreds of miles to a post, but it’s a possibility.
But with the river watched it would be the
most dangerous way of all. All they’d have to do
would be to smash our boat, or set it adrift in the current.
It would be all day with us then.”</p>

<p>“Just to keep us from escaping wouldn’t do Gault
any good,” said Loseis. “We have plenty of grub;
and help is bound to arrive in the end. That cannot
be the whole of his plan.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; not the whole of it,” said Conacher
grimly. “Time will tell.”</p>

<p>Loseis shivered. “Let’s get back under cover,” she
said.</p>

<p>Before returning to the house they made sure that
Conacher’s dug-out was still safe where he had left it
hidden in the willows with the paddle in the bottom.</p>

<p>“Who knows? It may come in handy,” he said.</p>

<p>The hours of that day dragged by with leaden feet.
Nothing happened, and that was the hardest thing to
bear. All needed sleep; and all were too highly keyed
up to obtain it. Clouds had come up with the sun, and
by breakfast time a soft persistent rain was falling,
driven in sheets by a cold wind from the northeast.
Sharp squalls swept across the little square at intervals,
almost blotting out the buildings opposite.</p>

<p>“Well, at any rate we’re better off than the other
fellows,” said Conacher with a grim chuckle. “We’ve
got a roof over our heads.”</p>

<p>After breakfast in spite of Loseis’ protests, he took
up his position in the open doorway, with his gun
across his knees. His view out of the window was too
much narrowed by the thickness of the log walls, he
explained.</p>

<p>“But you offer such a fair mark where you are!”
complained Loseis.</p>

<p>“Nobody could shoot me here except from behind
the house opposite,” said Conacher. “In order to do
that he’s got to show himself; and my eyes are as quick
as the next man’s.”</p>

<p>The house opposite bothered Conacher. “If they
gained possession of it, it would render our position
untenable, as they say in the army communiqués,” he
said.</p>

<p>It transpired that there were staples in the door,
and a padlock lying somewhere within to fasten it.
Conacher announced his intention of going across to
bar the shutters and lock the door.</p>

<p>And so it was done. Loseis stood at the door with
her gun to cover his passage to and fro across the
little square.</p>

<p>Loseis and Conacher, half exasperated, half affectionate,
disputed endlessly over who should bear the
heavier part of the burden.</p>

<p>“You <span class='it'>must</span> sleep!” insisted Loseis. “It is to-night
that the real danger will come.”</p>

<p>“You sleep first,” said Conacher, “and I’ll promise
to match whatever you do, later.”</p>

<p>Towards the end of the afternoon the sky cleared,
and the grass of the little square steamed up in the
warmth of the late sun.</p>

<p>“I’d give something to be able to run down to the
river and back to stretch my legs,” said Conacher longingly.</p>

<p>“Every foot of the flat is commanded from the
bench to the north,” said Loseis sharply.</p>

<p>“Very little danger of getting hit if I zigzagged,”
said Conacher, partly to tease her.</p>

<p>Loseis changed her tactics. “Very well, I’ll come
too,” she said.</p>

<p>“Not on your life!” said Conacher; and the subject
was dropped.</p>

<p>They ate their supper; the sun went down; and the
great stillness descended. Conacher closed and barred
the door then; and went back to the kitchen window.
The window was open; and the slender black barrel
of his rifle stuck out across the thick log that formed
its sill. Accustomed as they were to the evening stillness,
in this tense hour it struck awe into their breasts
as if it was the first time. They had an indefinable
feeling that whatever It was, It would come in this
hushed moment. Loseis was at her window; Mary-Lou
was crouched on the floor at the back of the room
with her hands pressed to her mouth.</p>

<p>Presently they heard that sound which is always associated
with the sunset stillness of the Northwest;
the long-drawn, intolerably mournful howl of a coyote;
a sound calculated to shake stretched nerves. It rose
startlingly close; in fact from the ravine through
which the creek flowed behind the men’s house opposite.</p>

<p>“That is no coyote,” said Loseis sharply. “They
never come so close to the Post.”</p>

<p>Mary-Lou moaned.</p>

<p>The cry was repeated; and was answered from
down the river.</p>

<p>“That coyote is afloat in a canoe,” said Conacher
with a grim chuckle. “The men who went down the
river to-day have been instructed to come back at evening
to watch us.”</p>

<p>Another heartrending howl was raised from the hill
back of the store.</p>

<p>“The outposts are establishing communications,”
said Conacher, carrying it off lightly in order to
hearten the girls. “Well, it’s a relief to know what
and where they are. At this God-awful moment of
the day you could imagine anything!”</p>

<p>For awhile the quavering cries went back and
forth; then silence. Darkness drew slowly in. At first
the sky across the river was like a sea of amber with
one or two scraps of cloud floating in it like golden
ships. As the warmth gradually faded out it took on
the hue of blued steel. The moon was rising later
now; to-night there would be an hour or so of darkness
before her coming. Conacher had to strain his
eyes to make out the details of the house across the
way.</p>

<p>The slow minutes passed. In the big chimney the
night-breeze kept up a gentle, uneven murmuring that
was like somebody speaking to somebody else a little
way off. Occasionally the man and the girl whispered
from room to room in the dark just to reassure themselves
of the other’s warm and breathing presence.</p>

<p>“Paul?”</p>

<p>“Yes, pardner?”</p>

<p>“There’s no need for both of us to be watching.”</p>

<p>“Well, you take a sleep, old girl.”</p>

<p>“Sleep!”</p>

<p>“My sentiments exactly!”</p>

<p>And later:</p>

<p>“Paul, do not remain at the window. Even though
they cannot see you, they will guess that you are there.
It is like a bull’s eye in the side of the house!”</p>

<p>“But I must be looking out!”</p>

<p>“Do as I do. Scrape away the clay, and use a chink
between the logs for a peep-hole.”</p>

<p>After that Paul lay full length on the floor of the
kitchen, with his rifle barrel poked out through the
chink.</p>

<p>Suddenly his gun roared outside, blowing the night
to pieces as it seemed. A dreadful, low cry escaped
from Mary-Lou.</p>

<p>“What was it?” whispered Loseis sharply.</p>

<p>“Man crawling towards the door of the men’s
house.”</p>

<p>“Did you get him?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Conacher ruefully. “He streaked back
around the corner. It was the merest shadow. I shot
too soon.”</p>

<p>There was another long wait, much harder to bear
for nerves that still recollected the explosion of that
shot. Then they became aware by a gentle grayness
pervading the scene outside, that the moon had risen.
The orb itself was hidden by the buildings opposite.</p>

<p>“He’s gone into the little warehouse beyond the
store,” said Conacher suddenly. “The door has been
opened.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Damn it! I should have locked that
door.”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t have locked it,” said Loseis. “They
broke the staples.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a good mind to go over there and get him,”
muttered Conacher.</p>

<p>“Right across the open, I suppose,” said Loseis bitterly.</p>

<p>“I might steal around behind the buildings.”</p>

<p>“There are probably others there.”</p>

<p>“If I sent a shot through the open door it would
give him a good scare.”</p>

<p>“Nothing to be gained by scaring him.”</p>

<p>The edge of the moon peeped over the ridge of the
men’s house. A few minutes later she was shining
directly into their faces. This had them at a cruel disadvantage,
for the other side of the square where one
or more of their enemies were lurking, was hidden in
the deepest shadow. Conacher swore helplessly under
his breath.</p>

<p>By and by a cloud crept across the moon dimming
her silvery glare.</p>

<p>“He’s come out of the warehouse,” said Conacher
in surprise. “The door is closed now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don’t
understand that. Why should he come out unless he
had found a better place? What other place is there
where he could sit in hiding and watch us?”</p>

<p>There was no answer forthcoming. The moon
came out again, bathing the little square within the
crouching buildings in her misty radiance. As she rose
higher their vision was the less obscured. Nothing
stirred outside. The earth was so still, one fancied
one could feel its great swing to the east. Time
passed, and that fear against which the bravest hearts
are not proof, lay upon them heavier and heavier; the
fear of the unknown.</p>

<p>Conacher at his loophole muttered and swore under
his breath. “When I knew where he was it was all
right.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. This is hellish .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. !”</p>

<p>Finally, when the eastern sky was beginning to get
ready for dawn, he jumped up. “I can’t stand this,”
he cried. “I’ve got to find out where they are, and
what they’re up to!”</p>

<p>Loseis found him in the dark. “Oh, hush!” she
whispered. “Maybe there’s an ear pressed against the
back wall! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. What are you going to do?”</p>

<p>Conacher put his lips to her ear. “Make a dummy,
and show it at the door,” he said. Even at that moment
a chuckle sounded in his voice.</p>

<p>They closed the shutters, stuffed up their peep-holes
and lighted a lamp. Conacher tied a broom to the
back of a chair with the brush uppermost. He then
tied a piece of firewood athwart the broom handle
just under the brush. This was for shoulders. They
dared not use hammer and nails. Upon this frame he
hung one of Mary-Lou’s dresses, and completed the
figure by forcing a small cooking pot over the brush
of the broom, with a piece of white cloth hanging
down in front to represent a face. In the moonlight
at a hundred paces distance they judged that it would
serve. Conacher blew out the light again.</p>

<p>“I’ll manipulate the chair,” he said to Loseis.
“You go back to your peep-hole. You must be watching
for the flash in case he shoots. Mary-Lou, you
must open the door. There’s no danger if you keep
behind it.”</p>

<p>Conacher waited until Loseis was at her place.
“All clear outside?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I can see nothing,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“All right then, Mary.”</p>

<p>They could hear her gasping softly for breath, as
she drew the door slowly open. The night stole into
the room. All three hearts were beating furiously.
Conacher, lying on the floor, grasped the legs of the
chair, and thrust it forward a little. At first he tipped
it to represent a face peeping around the doorframe,
and quickly withdrew it. After repeating this once or
twice, he allowed the whole figure to show in the doorway,
swaying a little like a living body.</p>

<p>“Any movement across the way?” he whispered to
Loseis.</p>

<p>“Nothing!”</p>

<p>Finally he allowed the figure to tip forward as if to
peer outside the door. From across the square two
shots crashed out almost simultaneously. One bullet
shattered the chair back; the other buried itself deep
in the log wall across the kitchen. It was a relief
to hear those shots, waiting for them was so dreadful.
Conacher jerked the remains of the chair out of sight,
and Mary-Lou slammed the door. All three of them
were panting for breath.</p>

<p>“Well?” demanded Conacher excitedly.</p>

<p>“They are inside my father’s house,” said Loseis
desperately.</p>

<p>“Impossible!” he cried in dismay.</p>

<p>“Yes! They are doing the same as us. Shooting
through chinks between the logs.”</p>

<p>“How could they have got in? There are no windows
in the back.”</p>

<p>“Who knows? Dug underneath the wall, maybe.”</p>

<p>For the first time Conacher showed discouragement.
“Oh, God!” he groaned. “By night or day they’ve
got us covered!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXI<br/> <span class='sub-head'>A LEAP FOR FREEDOM</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>O</span>n</span> the third morning following, Loseis and Conacher
were seated at a little table in the kitchen
of the Women’s House, with a scarcely touched meal
between them. In the inner room Mary-Lou was lying
on a mattress with her face turned towards the wall,
asleep—or despairing. In the kitchen all was in apple
pie order; a fire burning on the well-swept hearth with
a small pot of water bubbling upon it; the shutter of
the little window flung back, and the sunshine streaming
in; outside all green and peaceful to the eye.
There was nothing to indicate the horror of the situation
but the faces of the two at the table. Those gaunt
and gray young faces, deeply seamed and sunken
eyed, told a tale of seventy-two hours’ horror.
Neither had had more than a snatch or two of broken
sleep. Three endless nights and days and no hope of
relief. It was the absence of hope which had aged
them.</p>

<p>Conacher rested his cheek in his palm, and gloomily
traced imaginary lines on the oilcloth cover with his
fork. Loseis’ eyes, which looked truly enormous now,
were fixed on the young man’s face, all tenderness.</p>

<p>“You have brought all this on your head through
mixing in my miserable affairs,” she murmured.</p>

<p>He looked up quickly. “Oh, don’t say a thing like
that!” he protested, hurt to the quick. “It seems to
divide us. How can we be divided now? Your fate
is my fate and mine yours!”</p>

<p>Loseis looked down, somewhat comforted. But
she yearned for more explicit comfort still. “I wonder
you do not hate me,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Loseis!” he said sharply, “if you say such things
to me, you will have me blubbering like Mary-Lou.
That would be a nice thing!” And the tears actually
stood in his eyes.</p>

<p>The sight of those tears was sweet to Loseis; but
she went on perversely: “Sometimes I think you do
hate me. You do not like to look at me any more.
Always you turn your eyes away.”</p>

<p>Conacher turned his eyes away then. “The truth
is, I can’t bear to look at you,” he murmured. “Such
a child as you are, and so plucky and proud; never a
word of complaint out of you. It drives me wild to
think I can’t save you from this!”</p>

<p>Loseis glided swiftly around the table, and caught
his head against her breast. “Ah, you blessed Paul!”
she crooned, brooding over him. “I was just trying
to make you say again that you loved me. You
mustn’t grieve so over me. Think what it would be
for me if you weren’t here!”</p>

<p>She dropped to her knees beside his chair. Speech
would no longer serve to convey their feelings. They
snatched a moment of poignant happiness out of the
surrounding horror.</p>

<p>Finally Conacher, partly withdrawing himself from
her arms, sat up straight. “This can’t go on!” he
said, striking the table.</p>

<p>“What is in your mind?” she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“We have plenty of food,” he said, “and the water
is still holding out; but what is the use of it all? To
be trapped like this would break anybody’s nerve;
knowing night and day that the guns were covering
you. If we stay here they’re certain to get us in the
end. Time is passing. If we give them no opportunity
to pick us off, they’ll drive us out of our shelter.
They have only to build a fire against the back wall of
this house .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Heaven!” murmured Loseis.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to frighten you unnecessarily,” he
said, stroking back her hair; “but we’ve got to face
the worst. I’ve been looking for it to happen every
night. That’s why I couldn’t sleep. How simple
for Gault to shoot us down as we ran out, and throw
our bodies back on the fire .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I say we must
make a break for it, while we are able to choose our
own time.”</p>

<p>“But where could we go?” faltered Loseis.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking about that. God knows, I have
had plenty of time! The three obvious ways out are
closed to us, but there is a fourth way .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“Across the river and over the prairie to the north
or northwest.”</p>

<p>“But that is the unknown country!” said Loseis with
widening eyes. “No white man has ever been across
there!”</p>

<p>“True,” said Conacher; “but after all it’s just a
country like any other. And I’m accustomed to making
my own way.”</p>

<p>“Nobody knows what is on the other side!”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Conacher. “It’s part of my job to
map this country; and I carry the existing map in my
mind. Two or three hundred miles away—I can only
make a rough guess as to the distance; there is an important
river called the Mud River. We only have reports
of it from the Indians. But the name tells you
what kind of a river it is. It must be a prairie river
like this one; fairly deep and moderately swift. If
there are cottonwood trees I could make a rough dug-out;
or I could always make rafts. The Mud River
eventually falls into the Sinclair. It is up the Sinclair
River that my outfit is making its way at present. According
to their schedule they will make the mouth of
the Mud River on July fifteenth. That gives us a
month. If we are too late we could follow them up
the Sinclair. They travel slow on account of the work
they have to do. It is the best chance I see. No
woman has ever made such a journey, but men have;
and you are as plucky and strong as a boy.”</p>

<p>“I can do it if you can,” said Loseis quickly.
“But how could we escape from here with an outfit;
grub, blankets, ax, gun, ammunition?”</p>

<p>“It would have to be a mighty slim outfit,” said
Conacher. “I could feed you with my gun if I had
to.”</p>

<p>“Across the river there are only a few broken
horses,” said Loseis. “We could not be sure of finding
them at the moment we needed them.”</p>

<p>“We may have to walk,” said Conacher.</p>

<p>“But when Gault missed us, he could swim his
horses over. What chance would we have then?”</p>

<p>“Not much of a one.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But a crazy idea has
been coming back to me again and again. Maybe the
very craziness of it is in its favor.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“If we could persuade Gault that we had committed
suicide in our desperation .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. ?”</p>

<p>Loseis’ eyes widened like a child’s.</p>

<p>“Can you swim?” asked Conacher.</p>

<p>She sadly shook her head.</p>

<p>“Hm! that’s awkward.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. But maybe I could
manage.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. There is that little air pillow in my
outfit.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>They heard Mary-Lou approaching out of the next
room, and drew apart.</p>

<p>“What on earth will we do with her?” whispered
Loseis.</p>

<p>Conacher shook his head in complete perplexity.
“We’ll talk it over later,” he whispered.</p>

<p>Mary-Lou had come to clean up the breakfast
dishes. The past four days had made a shocking
change in the appearance of the comely Indian girl.
She was too apathetic to resent being excluded from
their counsels; and Conacher and Loseis went on with
their whispering.</p>

<p>All day they alternately whispered together, and
parted from each other to think over the matter
afresh. To have this absorbing matter to talk over
relieved the tension; the hours passed more quickly.
They surveyed their plan from every angle, continually
rejecting this expedient, and accepting that.
Little by little they built up a reasonable-seeming structure.
Of course the best plan they could make depended
upon so many chances for its success, that
there were many moments when they despaired. But
at such moments Conacher would always say: “Still,
anything would be better than this!” Whereupon
they would set their wits to work afresh.</p>

<p>Some hours later Conacher said: “One thing is certain.
It would have twice as good a chance of success
if we could prepare Gault’s mind beforehand for such
a thing to happen. We ought to send him a letter.”</p>

<p>“How could we send him a letter?” asked Loseis.</p>

<p>Recollecting the Indian trophies that hung on the
walls of Loseis’ room, Conacher went in there.
Loseis, following, saw him take down a bow, and test
the string.</p>

<p>“It has hardened some,” he said: “But it will do.”</p>

<p>Loseis, getting the idea, smiled. “But would they
dare to come out and get it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Oh, curiosity is a strong motive,” said Conacher.
“And anyway, I have suspected every night that they
came part way across the square at the darkest time
before the moon comes up, to make sure that we
didn’t slip out.”</p>

<p>They sat down to concoct the letter. “You must
write it,” said Conacher. “It would be more effective.”</p>

<p>After a couple of hours’ work and many drafts,
they produced the following:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p class='noindent'>“<span class='sc'>To Gault</span>:</p>

<p>“Why do you torture me so? I have never harmed
you. Mary-Lou died the first night, and we buried her
under the floor. Our water is gone. Conacher is acting
so strangely I am afraid of what he may do. He
doesn’t know I am writing this. I will shoot it over
to you while he sleeps. If there is any decency or
mercy in your heart let me see you ride away from
this place to-morrow. I cannot stand this any longer.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:2em;'>“<span class='sc'>Laurentia Blackburn.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>Conacher and Loseis smiled grimly over this effusion.
But Loseis quickly frowned.</p>

<p>“I cannot bear to have him think I would whine for
mercy like that,” she murmured.</p>

<p>“Yes, but think of the pleasure of fooling him
later,” Conacher pointed out.</p>

<p>To send their letter they chose a moment after sunset,
while there was still light enough to aim it.
Throwing open the door, they all stood back on the
chance of receiving a bullet from across the way: but
their enemies gave no sign. It fell to Loseis’ part to
dispatch the letter, since she was accustomed to handling
the bow and arrow. The letter had been fastened
around the shaft with a thread. After waiting a
moment or two, Loseis took up her stand far enough
back from the door so that she could not possibly be
seen. Drawing the bow-string to her ear, she let it
twang. The arrow sped across the open space, and
stuck fast in the wall of the men’s house, a few
inches from the door. Conacher slammed their door
shut.</p>

<p>Next morning as soon as it became light, they perceived
that the arrow still remained fixed in the wall.
Their hearts sunk, thinking that their ruse had failed.
But as the light strengthened Loseis’ sharp eyes discovered
that the white band around the shaft was
gone.</p>

<p>“They have it!” she cried.</p>

<p>All day long they anxiously watched for any sign
of activity on the part of their enemies. If any reply
had been made to their letter it might have seriously
embarrassed them, but none was made. As the endless,
endless day finally rounded towards its close,
Conacher said grimly:</p>

<p>“It must be to-night.”</p>

<p>Loseis nodded.</p>

<p>They did not take Mary-Lou into their confidence
until the latest possible moment. They supped; and
the dishes were washed. Finally when Conacher began
to lay out the bundles they were to carry, she had
to be told. The mind of the overwrought girl was
distracted by the thought of more danger.</p>

<p>“Let me stay here,” she moaned. “Let me stay
here and die!”</p>

<p>“Why die?” said Conacher patiently. “We’re
offering you a chance to live!”</p>

<p>“I cannot do it!”</p>

<p>“You have the easiest part of all,” Loseis pointed
out.</p>

<p>“We have told them that you are dead and buried,”
said Conacher laughing. “Whether they believe it or
not, they’re not going to bother about you until they
catch Loseis and me. We have only got to run from
the door to the corner of the house. There’s not one
chance in a hundred they can get us in that space if
we run abreast. Once around the corner we are out
of range until they can get out of the house.”</p>

<p>After long persuasion, Mary-Lou agreed to try it.</p>

<p>“Now listen,” said Conacher, with an appearance
of great cheerfulness; “here’s the plan. At the
corner of the house we divide. Loseis and I run down
to the flat, and strike for my dug-out, while you hit
directly into the woods behind this house. You are to
make your way entirely around the Post by the side
hill, and cross the creek, and make your way as best
you can to the Slavi village. Take your time to it.
If you get there by to-morrow night it will do. When
it is dark to-morrow night take three horses .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>“But not my horse,” put in Loseis. “She is too
well known.”</p>

<p>“Three horses,” resumed Conacher; “and as much
grub as Tatateecha will let you have.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>“They have plenty of smoked meat and smoked
fish,” said Loseis.</p>

<p>“What place can I appoint for a meeting?” asked
Conacher of Loseis.</p>

<p>“The Old Wives’ Slough. It is the furthest point
that I have been with my father. About ten miles
west of here, and the same distance north of the Slavi
village.”</p>

<p>“Have you been there?” Conacher asked Mary-Lou.</p>

<p>She shook her head.</p>

<p>“Do you know the North Star?”</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>“Good! Then take the horses and the grub when
it becomes dark to-morrow night, and ride ten miles in
the direction of the North Star to that slough in the
prairie.”</p>

<p>“There is a trail from the Slavi village,” put in
Loseis.</p>

<p>“Loseis and I will be waiting for you there,” said
Conacher.</p>

<p>“In the poplar bluff on the south side of the slough,”
added Loseis.</p>

<p>“If we are not there,” added Conacher with a smile
for Loseis’ benefit, “why, turn around and ride back
to the Slavi village.”</p>

<p>Conacher repeated these instructions over again,
and made Mary-Lou say it all after him. Both he and
Loseis feared that in the unnerved red girl they had
but a broken reed to lean upon. However they had
no other. Once clear of that den of horror they hoped
that she might recover herself somewhat.</p>

<p>Then the packs were made. Each was to take a
blanket with a small package of food rolled up inside
it. In addition Conacher had his gun and an ammunition
belt containing a hundred shells, and a small
cooking-pot packed with matches, tea and tobacco.
Loseis was to take a smaller belt of shells and a small
ax. Mary-Lou was given Conacher’s smaller gun
and ammunition for it. Everything was to be strapped
on their backs, in order to leave both arms free.</p>

<p>“How shall we know the proper moment to start
out?” asked Loseis.</p>

<p>“The moon does not rise to-night until after midnight,”
said Conacher. “The darkest time will be
about two hours after sundown. I will mark a
candle and light it when the sun goes down. When it
has burned two inches we will make a break.”</p>

<p>“That will only give us an hour or so before the
moon comes up.”</p>

<p>“The first few minutes will decide everything,” he
said, smiling at her.</p>

<p>They were ready, of course, long before it was time
to set out. Conacher made it his job to keep up the
spirits of his little party. He suggested having another
meal, but no one ate but himself. After that
there was nothing to do but sit down and look at the
candle. Very hard on the nerves. A half a dozen
times Loseis sprang up like a haggard little panther,
crying:</p>

<p>“It’s perfectly dark. Let’s start.”</p>

<p>To which Conacher would always reply in his calm
and cheerful style: “No! When you settle on a
thing, you must stick to it.”</p>

<p>As the candle burned down towards the fateful
mark, the three pairs of eyes were fixed on it in painful
intensity, and three hearts rose slowly into three
throats. The last ten minutes were the hardest.</p>

<p>“Now!” said Conacher briskly, at last.</p>

<p>They adjusted their packs. Under her pack Loseis
wore the deflated air pillow fastened between her
shoulders by a harness of twine contrived by Conacher.
Both Loseis and Conacher felt that this might well be
the moment of farewell, but neither spoke of it. It
was all expressed in an exchange of looks. Mary-Lou
was piteously striving to get her breath. Conacher’s
last act before leaving was to throw a pailful of the
precious water on the fire, that no reflection of the
glow might betray them when the door was opened.
The room was filled with hissing steam.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment,” whispered Conacher in the darkness.
“They might possibly have heard that sound.
Give them time to forget it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Me first, then
Loseis, then Mary-Lou. Take hands. Run like hell
around the corner of the house.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am opening
the door now.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>They ran out and turned, putting every nerve into it.
Instantly, the guns across the grass roared out. They
heard the twin bullets plug deep into the logs behind
them. The guns crashed again. They gained the
corner of the house unhurt. Immediately the cry of
the coyote was raised not a hundred yards away; almost
in their ears it seemed. It was more human than
coyote. Their enemies were outside the house. Already
they could hear the sound of running feet.
Other cries answered the first one: from the hill behind;
from the ravine; from the river.</p>

<p>Loseis gave Mary-Lou a gentle push; and the Indian
girl disappeared noiselessly into the bush back of the
house. Conacher and Loseis took hands and raced
down the grassy rise. A voice behind them shouted
in English:</p>

<p>“There they go!”</p>

<p>Conacher whispered: “Make first for the creek;
then double back towards the willows!”</p>

<p>The surface of the natural meadow was rough, and
Conacher went down twice, but was up again like the
recoil of a spring. Loseis had the mysterious sure-footedness
of an Indian. Behind them they heard
their pursuers falling and cursing. Gault’s voice
shouted a command in Cree.</p>

<p>“He is telling them to make for the creek,” whispered
Loseis.</p>

<p>When they had almost reached the edge of the
creek bank, they turned sharply to the right, and
headed back obliquely across the flat towards the
point where the dug-out was hidden. They slackened
their pace that they might not betray their whereabouts
by further falls. This maneuver was successful
for the moment. They heard their pursuers halt at
the creek bank. Gault called to men who were evidently
approaching down the bed of the creek.</p>

<p>The fugitives gained the river bank, and crawling
under the thick willows, presently stumbled on the
dug-out lying in a fissure in the earthen bank. So far
so good. However, they were not unmindful of the
dug-out manned by four Crees somewhere out on the
river; and they waited awhile listening.</p>

<p>They heard them coming up-stream, paddling at a
furious rate. They passed close to the bank, not half
a dozen yards from where Loseis and Conacher were
crouching. Conacher gave them a minute, then started
to slide the dug-out off the mud.</p>

<p>“They’ll see us!” whispered Loseis in alarm.</p>

<p>“Somebody must see us, or we can’t pull off the
double suicide,” said Conacher grimly.</p>

<p>They launched the dug-out and climbed in. Since
the paddlers in the other dug-out had their backs turned
to them, they could have gained the other shore unseen;
but Conacher headed diagonally up-stream, laying
such a course that they must be at least heard by
those gathered around the mouth of the creek. And
they were heard. A chorus of cries was raised. Conacher
then steered straight for the opposite shore. In
a moment they heard the other dug-out splashing after
them.</p>

<p>Immediately to the north of the high-cut bank, there
was a smallish flat covered with grass, through the
center of which a tiny stream wound its way to the
river. It was the usual willow-bordered rivulet flowing
quite deep between overhanging banks, which were
held from caving in by the roots of the thickly springing
willows. The branches of the willows interlaced
overhead. This muskrat-haunted stream was an important
factor in the plans of the fugitives; but they
were not ready to use it yet.</p>

<p>Conacher landed alongside its mouth. The instant
the nose of the dug-out touched, they were out.
The other dug-out was already half way across the
river. They raced through the grass alongside the
willow-bordered stream, slipping out of their packs as
they ran. A hundred yards or so from the river, Conacher
took both packs and boring through the outer
willows, tied the packs to branches overhanging the
little stream.</p>

<p>Returning to Loseis, they doubled on their tracks,
and ran for the steep grassy rise which culminated in
the bold knoll where the two graves were. The Crees,
having just landed, were stumbling through the grass
at a loss. Presently the fugitives were seen, as they
wished to be. With renewed cries to their friends
across the river, the Crees set after them. Gault’s
roaring voice was heard from the river.</p>

<p>“They told him that we were running up the hill,”
whispered Loseis; “and he’s telling them to work
around back, and head us off on top.”</p>

<p>“We may take our time then,” said Conacher, falling
to a walk.</p>

<p>On top of the knoll they came to a stand. The little
enclosure containing the two graves was behind them;
and behind that again, the grove of pines. On either
side the ground sloped steeply down, and in front it
broke off into nothingness.</p>

<p>“Well, here we are,” said Conacher lightly; “that
was easy!”</p>

<p>“The hardest is before us,” murmured Loseis.</p>

<p>Stepping to the edge of the cut-bank, they looked
over. The precipitous slide of earth, almost as pale
as snow at their feet, was gradually swallowed in the
murk. The fact that they could not see the bottom of
it, made the leap appear doubly terrible.</p>

<p>“Does your heart fail you, dear?” murmured Conacher.</p>

<p>“Not as long as you are beside me,” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Remember to let yourself go limp when you hit the
dirt,” he said. “Gravity will do the rest. I’ll be there
before you, because I’m heavier.”</p>

<p>He blew up the little air cushion that was strapped
to her back.</p>

<p>They could hear the Crees working around the
north side of the hill. It was evidently expected that
the fugitives meant to run back along the top of the
ridge. Below them the river revealed itself merely as
a grayish band, a shade or two lighter than its shores.
They could just make out the disturbance created by
two furiously driven bark canoes about to land below.
These had headed for the south side of the hill.
There was some underbrush on that side; and when
the occupants landed they could be heard smashing
through it. They were evidently working up that side
with the object of coming in touch with the other
party.</p>

<p>“This is better than I could have hoped for,” said
Conacher cheerfully. “We have got them all on the
hill.”</p>

<p>“Is it time to go now?” asked Loseis nervously.</p>

<p>“No! No! Wait until they are right on top of
us.”</p>

<p>Somewhere back of them the two parties met on top
of the ridge. There was a whispered consultation,
then a silence, very hard for the listeners to bear.
Conacher held Loseis’ hand tightly squeezed within
his own. Up there under the wide spreading night
sky they became queerly aware of their insignificance.
A long silence; then from half a dozen sounds their
sharpened senses informed them that their enemies
were creeping towards them through the pines.</p>

<p>Loseis caught her breath sharply, and moved towards
the edge.</p>

<p>“Steady, sweetheart,” whispered Conacher.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was an astonished cry of: “There!”
and a rush of feet.</p>

<p>Loseis and Conacher cried out wildly, as they had
rehearsed together: “Good-by! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Good-by, all!”
And leaped.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>THE SEARCH</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>L</span>oseis</span> could never have described the sensations
of that mad roll down the cut-bank. As a matter
of fact all sensation was whirled clean out of her; and
the first thing she knew was the mighty smack with
which her body hit the water. Water it seemed could
be almost as hard as wood. She went under.</p>

<p>As she rose again, gasping and wildly reaching, her
fingers came in contact with Conacher’s coat. In the
first second she clutched him in a deathlike grip; in the
second she remembered he had told her they would
both drown, if she did so; and she released him. She
discovered that the air cushion was sufficient to hold
her up.</p>

<p>Conacher whispered in her ear: “You are all right?”</p>

<p>“I .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think so,” she stuttered.</p>

<p>“Put your two hands lightly on my shoulders and I’ll
tow you. Do not splash.”</p>

<p>He swam softly down with the current.</p>

<p>In the first moment there was only silence from
above. Then they heard Gault’s excited voice:</p>

<p>“Quick! the canoes! Search for them in the river!”</p>

<p>The men came tearing pell-mell down the hill, and
Conacher swam with all his strength for the mouth of
the little stream.</p>

<p>They gained it none too soon. Finding firm ground
underfoot they waded up-stream under the arching willows.
The water was up to their waists. They had to
move at a snail’s pace to avoid splashing. As soon as
the upper part of their bodies was exposed to the air,
they realized the numbing cold of the water. Loseis
clenched her teeth to keep them from chattering.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the two dug-outs had been launched.
The men shouted confusedly at each other. Such a
search was hopeless in the dark. They could hear
Gault savagely cursing his men. It was quite clear
that he was not bent upon rescuing the two, but upon
making sure that they did not escape. The voices
softened in the distance, as the current carried the
dug-outs down. Conacher and Loseis could now permit
themselves to move faster through the water.</p>

<p>Conacher drew Loseis along with one hand, and
held the other straight over his head as they proceeded
through the dark tunnel. An exclamation of satisfaction
escaped him as his hand came in contact with the
hanging packs. He took them down. A short distance
further along there was a break in the willows
on the right-hand side, and a back-water whence they
climbed out in the grass. Streaming with water, they
set off at a jog trot to warm up.</p>

<p>The voices of Gault and the Crees were still receding.
Simultaneously it occurred to Conacher and
Loseis that they could now permit themselves to hope.
Stopping, they flew into each other’s arms. It was a
moist embrace, but none the less rapturous. After the
frightful strain of the past days, the reaction was unnerving.
In their joy and relief, they both partly
broke down; but neither was ashamed of showing
emotion.</p>

<p>“Oh, my Paul!” murmured Loseis. “Perhaps we
are going to be happy after all!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps?” cried Conacher. “I should like to see
anybody stop us now?”</p>

<p>He was not, however, quite so sure as all that.</p>

<p>The river flat gradually narrowed down to the typical
coulee of the prairies, with the little stream running
in the bottom. As the ground began to rise, the
willows ceased, and the way became rough and stony.
Conacher struck obliquely up the steep side of the
coulee to find better going over the prairie. The moon
rose as they gained the upper level, throwing a strange
misty glamour over that vast, fixed, rolling sea. They
pressed briskly ahead through the short buffalo grass
which did not impede the feet, keeping the North Star
over their right shoulders. Their clothes dried slowly;
but the exercise of walking kept them warm.</p>

<p>Their hearts were light. The awful bare solitudes,
rise behind rise in endless succession, and the deathlike
silence had no power to oppress them now. How
could they feel lonely walking hand in hand free under
the sky? Day stole upon them with enchanting beauty.
The prairie was sprinkled with wild roses and the rose
madder flower that is called painter’s brush. Prairie
chickens fluttered from bush to bush companionably;
and little furry four-footed creatures scurried for the
shelter of their holes. Loseis sang as she walked; and
Conacher cracked his jokes.</p>

<p>The sun was rising behind them as they came to the
edge of a wide, saucer-like depression in the prairie,
holding in the bottom an oval pond of an astonishing
blueness. It was dotted with snowy water fowl.
All the surrounding country dimpled like a vast cheek
in smooth rounds and hollows, was mantled with a
tender green, grayish in the shadows. At the left
hand side of the lake grew a wide patch of poplar
scrub; that is to say, thousands of little saplings growing
as thick as hair, and putting forth leaves of so intense
a green it was like a shout in the morning. The
whole picture was washed with rose color in the horizontal
rays of the rising sun.</p>

<p>Loseis drew a long breath. “I never realized
how beautiful the prairie was!” she murmured. “It
never was so beautiful,” she amended, putting her
hand on Conacher’s arm. “How marvelous to one
who has been a prisoner! Even if they should catch
us we shall have had this!”</p>

<p>“They’re not going to catch us,” said Conacher.
“Not while I have a hundred shells in my belt.”</p>

<p>Loseis pointed to the poplar scrub. “That’s the
meeting place with Mary-Lou to-night.”</p>

<p>“Too bad we have to waste the day waiting for
her,” said Conacher. “We won’t hang about there,
it’s too obvious a hiding-place. The high ground on the
other side would be a good observation post. Tired?”</p>

<p>“Tired!” sang Loseis. “I am just beginning to feel
that I have legs again!”</p>

<p>They headed obliquely across the depression towards
a swell of land to the south that enjoyed a slight
prominence in the gently rolling sea of grass. The
flat appearance of the prairie was deceptive. Some of
these insignificant bumps commanded a view for many
miles.</p>

<p>Tucked down behind the rise they found a cozy
hollow with another patch of the vivid poplar scrub.
They sat down at the edge of it to eat part of the
food they had brought.</p>

<p>While they were thus engaged, silently and with excellent
appetite, a brown bear came ambling placidly
out from among the saplings. He looked at them
with a start of astonishment so comic that Loseis
burst out laughing; then with a great “Woof!” of indignation
galloped away up the rise.</p>

<p>Conacher had snatched up his gun. “Fresh meat!”
he cried. But with a reluctant shake of his head, he
dropped it again.</p>

<p>“Why not?” asked Loseis.</p>

<p>“If we are searched for, the carcass would be
found.”</p>

<p>When they had finished eating, Conacher said: “I’m
sorry I cannot let you have a fire; but the smoke would
betray us for many miles around. Creep in among the
trees; take off your damp clothes; wrap up in your
blanket and sleep until I call you.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to do?” demanded Loseis,
ready to quarrel with him as usual over who should
bear the brunt of the hardship.</p>

<p>“I’m going to roll up and sleep at the top of the
rise behind a rose bush,” said Conacher grinning. “If
they send out a search party they may be expected to
appear in about two hours.”</p>

<p>“You are always talking about their searching for
us,” said Loseis. “If Gault thinks we are dead he will
not look for us. If he thinks we are not dead, we are
certain to be caught in these empty spaces. Why
worry?”</p>

<p>“There is a third alternative,” said Conacher.
“Gault thinks we are dead, but he cannot afford to
take any chances. It seems to me he will send out a
party to scour the prairie just as a precaution. It is
up to us to keep out of their way until they are satisfied.
It won’t be as bad as if they <span class='it'>knew</span> we were
here.”</p>

<p>Loseis wished to be allowed to watch from the top
of the rise, but Conacher carried his point.</p>

<p>From behind the clump of roses that he had marked
on the way over, Conacher was able to survey an expanse
of country that faded into gray mist on the horizon.
He slept for awhile as he had promised. It
was about nine o’clock by the sun, when he perceived
the first horseman, no more than a black dot far to the
eastward; but a significantly shaped dot. Presently
he made out another, and another at wide intervals.
The nearest was about four miles distant.</p>

<p>Racing back down the rise, he called to Loseis.
When she answered, he said: “Dress as quickly as
possible. We must move on.”</p>

<p>When she appeared from among the trees, he explained
what he had seen. “Unless I miss my guess,”
he said, “they will divide and ride around the high
ground surrounding the slough until they meet again.
That would bring us right in their line of march. We
must get over another rise. You can see that they are
combing the country as they come. What we ought to
do is to work around behind them.”</p>

<p>Hand in hand like a pair of children they headed
south, bent almost double as they climbed the rises,
and racing free down the other side. When they had
put a couple of heights between them and the slough,
they began to work around towards the east. The
prairie is not such a desperate place for fugitives as it
might seem. It is true that from the high places you
can see for many miles around: but there are always
hollows into which you cannot see until you are upon
them. At a glance it seems as if the bubbles of earth
had been pushed up in meaningless disorder; but such
is not the case. Nature sees to it that the country is
drained. Every hollow opens into another. Conacher
had the mapmaker’s instinct for the contour of
land, and he was never in doubt as to their proper
course. At the same time while they were hidden
from their enemies their enemies were hidden from
them. It caused the heart to rise in the throat to
imagine a horseman suddenly appearing over the grass
close by.</p>

<p>After an hour’s walking and running, they came
upon a good-sized patch of rose scrub folded into the
side of a rise. Conacher stopped to survey it.</p>

<p>“A perfect hiding-place if you lay flat on the
ground,” he said; “yet no one would suppose it. Come
on, let’s tackle the thorns.”</p>

<p>Inch by inch they threaded their painful way along
the ground; careful to rearrange the branches they
had disturbed upon entering; and cutting with their
knives a little tunnel ahead. Finally in the thickest
of the patch they lay companionably on the warm, dry
ground within whispering distance of each other, and
lapped in delicious fragrance. Themselves concealed,
they could see out more or less through interstices between
the leaves.</p>

<p>“One could fall asleep here, and dream of being in
Paradise,” said Loseis, sniffing.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Conacher, disengaging a thorn; “and
roll over and find one’s self in the other place!”</p>

<p>They both dozed, and were awakened simultaneously
by the sound of thudding hoofs. They waited
with fast-beating hearts. A dark-skinned horseman
rode into view along the top of the very rise against
whose side they lay. He was less than a hundred
yards away; they could distinguish every detail of
his somewhat dandified dress.</p>

<p>“Watusk,” whispered Loseis.</p>

<p>At sight of the patch of scrub, the Cree reined up
his horse, and sat staring directly at them. It caused
the goose-flesh to rise upon their bodies; their hearts
seemed to stop beating. With infinite caution Conacher
drew his gun into position.</p>

<p>“The horse first; then his rider,” he whispered.</p>

<p>But after debating a moment, the Cree clapped heels
to his horse, and rode on. Presently he disappeared.
A long breath of thankfulness escaped from the two
hidden ones.</p>

<p>“He will never know how nearly his wife became a
widow,” said Conacher.</p>

<p>“Well, they’ve checked this place off,” said Loseis.
“Shall we stay here?”</p>

<p>Conacher shook his head. “This will be his second
big circle around the slough,” he said. “If he repeats
the maneuver he will pass to the south of us. I don’t
like the notion of being hemmed in. We’ve got to
think of to-night. If they are making the slough their
headquarters they will camp there. Unless we head
Mary-Lou off she would ride right into them.”</p>

<p>“We must be close upon the trail between the Slavi
village and the slough,” said Loseis.</p>

<p>“But we’re still too near the slough. We must
make further south.”</p>

<p>Once more they took to the grass. For several
hours they saw no more of the searchers. They made
their last spell in a poplar bluff (as the patches of
scrub are called) overlooking the trail between the
lake and the slough, but much nearer the former.</p>

<p>They had not been there long when they were filled
with disquietude by the sight of another of the Crees
approaching from the direction of the Slavi village.</p>

<p>“He’s been in to look about,” said Conacher.
“Natural enough.” As the man drew closer he added
with a certain relief: “He doesn’t look as if he had
discovered anything important. I guess Mary-Lou
has side-stepped him.”</p>

<p>Their thoughts were given a sudden new turn, when
the Cree turning out of the trail, put his horse directly
for the bluff, Conacher and Loseis hastily retreated
within the thickest part of the miniature wood. The
Cree could not ride in among the little trees. Dismounting,
he tied his horse.</p>

<p>Then began a grim game of I Spy with death for
the stakes. Conacher and Loseis enjoyed a certain
advantage, because they were aware of their danger,
while the redskin was not. He was merely following
general instructions to search all likely places of concealment.
He was taking no particular care to muffle
the sound of his progress, and they could generally
follow it. When he went one way they went the other.
But there were harrowing periods when they could
hear nothing. The bluff was over an acre in extent,
and it was impossible to see more than half a dozen
yards through the thickly springing stems. Once he
caught them in a corner, and they were almost forced
out into the open. Another time they actually had a
glimpse of his passing. They stood frozen in their
tracks. With what thankful hearts they heard him
return to his horse at last. They flung themselves
down to let the hideous strain relax.</p>

<p>They ate again. Satisfied now, that they had done
their utmost, they rolled up in their blankets, and slept
for eight hours on end. It was twilight when they
awoke. They ate the last of the food they had
brought.</p>

<p>“It will be prairie chicken for breakfast if Mary-Lou
doesn’t come,” remarked Conacher.</p>

<p>“She will come if they have not taken her,” said
Loseis confidently.</p>

<p>“What I am chiefly afraid of,” said Conacher, “is
that she will pass right out with fright when we rise
beside the trail.”</p>

<p>“When we were children we used to signal to each
other by imitating the cry of the kill-dee,” said Loseis.
“I will try that.”</p>

<p>When the stars came out they moved down beside
the faint track worn in the buffalo grass. Conacher,
pulling his blanket around his shoulders, squatted in
the grass, smoking, and Loseis leaned her cheek
against his shoulder.</p>

<p>“How strange!” she murmured.</p>

<p>“What is, sweetheart?”</p>

<p>“Us two little things out here in the middle of the
bald-headed. I feel about an inch high under these
stars.”</p>

<p>“Better than last night,” suggested Conacher.</p>

<p>“Rather! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Paul, if we ever have any children,
I wonder if this will mean anything to them?”</p>

<p>Conacher was more moved than he cared to show.
Loseis, scarcely more than a child herself, dreaming
of having children of her own! “Surely!” he said
with assumed lightness. “Think how they’ll be able
to put it over the other kids! ‘My Ma and my Pa
were chased by Injuns!’ ”</p>

<p>Loseis chuckled. “If we come through all right
it will be a wonderful thing to have shared,” she murmured.
“It will help us over the tiresome parts.”</p>

<p>“You’re a wise little duck!” he whispered.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Other girls refuse to admit beforehand that there
could be any tiresome parts.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” she asked quickly.</p>

<p>He swallowed his chuckle. “Oh, you learn these
things from books, and from other men,” he said.</p>

<p>“I know that I shall not be marrying an angel,” she
said, nestling against him; “and I assure you that you
are not.”</p>

<p>“Angel enough for me!” he said, kissing her.</p>

<p>There was a vibration in the stillness. At first they
thought it was a trick of the desirous imagination;
then by degrees they became sure. Horses were approaching
along the trail at a walk. The slowness of
the pace was eloquent of the red girl’s terrors, and of
the loyalty and strength of will that forced her out
into the night in spite of her terrors. Conacher and
Loseis rose to their feet.</p>

<p>Finally they made out shadowy forms in the trail.
Loseis uttered the plaintive cry of the little bird that
haunts the edges of the prairie sloughs. The shadowy
horses stopped. There was a moment of painful suspense.
It was not a natural place, of course, to find
the kill-dee.</p>

<p>“Risk it!” whispered Conacher. “Speak to her!”</p>

<p>“Mary-Lou,” said Loseis softly; “we are here!”</p>

<p>There was no answer. They apprehended through
the dark that the solitary rider had slipped out of the
saddle. Running forward they found her half fainting,
but clinging to the horses still.</p>

<p>She quickly recovered. Ah! what a joyful reunion
that was! Sharers in danger!—there is no other
bond quite the same as this. They all babbled at once.
Loseis and Mary-Lou clung to each other weeping;
Conacher embraced them both indiscriminately.</p>

<p>“I so scare’!” Mary-Lou whispered in Loseis’ ear.
“I know the Crees out here somewhere. I t’ink they
get you sure. But I got come jus’ the same. When
I see you in the trail I t’ink it is the Crees. I am near
die then!”</p>

<p>“You’re the bravest of any of us!” whispered
Loseis. “Because you know what fear is!”</p>

<p>While the girls whispered Conacher turned his attention
to the horses. Mary-Lou had brought the
best procurable, and he was well-pleased. She had
brought a fair store of smoked meat and fish also, but
not enough to see them through, of course.</p>

<p>“Tatateecha t’ink I lyin’ till he see me start,” she
explained.</p>

<p>“Let us ride,” said Conacher. “We can talk as we
go.”</p>

<p>They mounted. The horses were still fresh and
coquettish with the bit. What a delight it was to feel
good horseflesh between the knees once more. Their
breasts swelled with renewed hope.</p>

<p>“Which way?” asked Loseis.</p>

<p>“Southwest,” said Conacher; “because that is the
direction they would least expect us to take. At daylight
we’ll turn, and lay our proper course northwest.
Save your horses.”</p>

<p>They set off at an easy trot. When the horses
settled to their work, they let the reins lie loose on
their necks. It was safest to let these prairie-bred
beasts choose their own footing. Now the North Star
must be kept over the horse’s right flank. Conacher
chose a bright star in the southwest for a beacon. As
they rode they exchanged experiences. Mary-Lou
said:</p>

<p>“Las’ night all the Crees around the post is after
you, so I have no trouble. I walk around the side
of the hill, and cross the creek, and climb the ridge.
I hide in the bush till daylight. I hear you cry:
‘Good-by! Good-by!’ across the river. That cry it
hurt my heart though I know it is a fool. I t’ink
maybe you break a leg on the cut-bank. In the morning
I see where some Crees is camp beside the trail,
and I go around them. Then I go back to the trail
and run to the Slavi village. I am there before the
sun is half way up the sky. I sleep long.”</p>

<p>“What did you do when the Cree came in?” asked
Loseis.</p>

<p>“Wah! He come down from the prairie when nobody
is lookin’ that way. All are scare’! I snatch up
a shawl and put it over my head like the ot’er women.
I stay with the ot’er women. He not know me. Bam-bye
he go back again.”</p>

<p>The course they were following led them roughly
parallel with Blackburn’s Lake. When the moon rose
they could see it palely gleaming in the distance. It
was an exhilarating ride; the wind created by their
own passage blew cool about their faces; the exercise
of riding kept them tingling. With every additional
mile that they put between them and their enemies
their hearts rose. Conacher attempted to sing. But
though there was no danger in raising the voice here,
the great brooding silence was too much for him. In
spite of themselves they talked in undertones.</p>

<p>Just before dawn they spelled alongside a poplar
bluff to allow the horses to graze. Here the humans
enjoyed the luxury of a fire again, and the stimulus
of hot food. Though the meal was only of smoked
fish without sauce or bread, such a complete sense of
comfort is not to be had under civilized conditions.
They groaned at the necessity of breaking camp.</p>

<p>After a two-hour rest they saddled, and turned at
right angles to their former course. The sun had
risen in a cloudless sky, and the air was like wine. At
mid-morning they calculated that they were abreast
of Old Wives’ Slough again, but now many miles to
the westward. Coming to another sapphire-colored
slough lying under a rather prominent rise to the
eastward, which had a well-grown poplar bluff on its
slope, Conacher called a halt for the balance of the
day.</p>

<p>“We need sleep,” he said; “moreover it is just possible
if they ride west to-day, that they might catch
sight of us from some height or another. The horses
will be well hidden alongside the bluff yonder.”</p>

<p>Picketing the horses to keep them from straying,
they ate again. On this occasion Loseis insisted on being
allowed to stand the first watch; and Conacher
dispatched her to the top of the rise, while he rolled
up in his blanket.</p>

<p>In the afternoon he relieved her. From the top of
the rise it was evident that this was the highest point
in many miles around. To Conacher lying in the grass
smoking, it seemed as if half the world was spread
before him. In that crystal clearness he could even
trace the line of the valley of Blackburn’s River. The
easterly horizon was closed in by the land rising on
the other side of the river. The pale green sea of the
prairie between was always the same, and never quite
the same. Apparently every yard of it was open to
his vision; but Conacher knew from past experience
that this was not so. Every swell of the land melted
so softly into the swell beyond that one could not
guess the hollow between. Conacher remembered the
old-time stories of how the Indians could steal up on
the wagon-trains camped in the open prairie.</p>

<p>As if evoked by that thought he saw Indians riding
towards him then. It was what he was looking for and
least desired to see. He glimpsed them as they crossed
a hollow; a moment later they trotted over a little
rise. There were three of them, they were less than
a mile away; they were heading directly for the spot
where he lay. This time an encounter could not be
avoided. All his high hopes came tumbling down like
a house of cards.</p>

<p>Conacher ran down the hill to alarm his camp.
There was no time to ride away. Best for them to
keep the shelter they had. A word told Loseis and
Mary-Lou what was upon them. They led the horses
close up behind the bluff of trees, and tied them. They
scattered the remaining embers of the fire, and beat
them out. Conacher and Loseis took up a position
within the trees facing the summit of the rise, gun in
hand. The girl’s face was pale and resolute.</p>

<p>“I can shoot straight, too,” she said quietly.</p>

<p>They waited.</p>

<p>“All three of them are together now,” said Conacher.
“We must get them all. And their horses too.
If we get them all it will be some time before Gault
learns what has happened. We will still have a
chance.”</p>

<p>The three horsemen appeared at the top of the
rise, and reined up. They were quite at their ease.
Each slung a leg over his saddle to rest, and produced
a pipe. There they stayed, silhouetted against
the tender blue sky. One had a pair of field-glasses
which was passed from hand to hand. Conacher and
Loseis instinctively drew back a little further amongst
the saplings. Suddenly the horses behind them
whinnied; and Conacher groaned in bitterness of
spirit.</p>

<p>However, at that moment a small troop of wild
horses appeared out of a depression to the north.
Led by a bay stallion with arched neck and streaming
tail, they trotted past. In the chorus of neighing and
whinnying which arose, the sounds made by Conacher’s
horses escaped the notice of the Crees.</p>

<p>After what seemed like an age-long wait to the
watchers hidden in the poplars, the three Indians
slipped out of their saddles, tightened girths and
mounted again.</p>

<p>“Now for it!” whispered Conacher. “Do not fire
until they are within a hundred feet. Bring down the
horses first. You take the piebald and I’ll take the
other two.”</p>

<p>But to their amazement and delight the riders
wheeled and disappeared the way they had come. For
a moment they stared at the empty place with hanging
mouths. Then Conacher made as if to run out from
among the trees. Loseis clutched him.</p>

<p>“It may be a trick!” she gasped.</p>

<p>They waited several minutes, not daring to rejoice
yet.</p>

<p>“I <span class='it'>must</span> go look!” said Conacher. “I must know
what they are doing.”</p>

<p>Loseis made no further effort to restrain him; and
he ran up to the top of the rise, and flung himself
down. At first he could see nothing but grass. Then
the three riders rose mysteriously out of the grass,
trotting away as they had come; showing their backs
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. their <span class='it'>backs</span>! Conacher nearly choked with joy.
He waited awhile yet to make doubly sure. They disappeared
and appeared again, holding steadily to the
east. They shrank to mere specks in the green sea.</p>

<p>Conacher leaped to his feet, and charged back down
the hill, yelling and brandishing his gun. Loseis
snatched up her gun warily. Not until he came close
did she comprehend that this was a pantomime of joy.
He swept her clean off her feet in his embrace.</p>

<p>“They’ve gone back!” he shouted. “This was the
outer edge of their patrol. They’ve given up the
search! After this we’ve got nothing to contend with
but nature!”</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='273' id='Page_273'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXIII<br/> <span class='sub-head'>HUNGER</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>N</span>ature! They</span> were to discover during the days
that followed that she was no mean antagonist.
At first everything went delightfully; the sun warmed
and cheered them by day; the stars whispered at night.
The moon was swallowed up in the dawn now. On
the shortest night of the year there was scarcely any
darkness; then the nights began to lengthen imperceptibly.
They rode and spelled and rode again.
They built great fires. The character of the country
never changed. The sea of green grass seemed to be
limitless.</p>

<p>On the third day the horse that Conacher rode sickened
mysteriously. On the following morning it was
incapable of bearing him. Loseis shook her head ominously.</p>

<p>“It is a sort of distemper that attacks them in the
summer,” she said. “He will be sick for weeks. We
might as well leave him. The others may catch it
from him.”</p>

<p>So Conacher was obliged to set out on foot. The
sick horse screamed piteously upon being left behind;
and attempted to follow; but fell down in the grass,
where he lay struggling feebly and watching them with
raised head until they passed out of sight. They could
not now hope to make more than thirty or forty miles
a day, though all took turns in riding. And still there
was no suggestion of their approach to a great river.
The prairie rolled on as before. As far as Conacher
could tell they had not yet even passed the crown of
the watershed. They all had their sickening moments
of doubt. Suppose there was no river?</p>

<p>Loseis’ worst prognostications were fulfilled. The
other two horses sickened. By the sixth day they were
all on foot. Mary-Lou’s moccasins wore through;
and they had nothing out of which to make new ones.
Fortunately both Loseis and Conacher wore boots.
The prairie which looked so smooth made rough walking
for humans, and their progress was cut down, Conacher
figured, to between twenty and twenty-miles [missing or incorrect word] a
day. The eighth day passed without any sign of the
river of promise. Conacher estimated that they had
covered nearly three hundred miles.</p>

<p>They had met with no game on the prairie except
the ubiquitous chickens. Conacher was averse to
wasting his precious bullets on such small fowl—it is
very easy to miss a prairie chicken with a rifle; consequently
they had depended on the meat and fish
brought by Mary-Lou. On the seventh day it was exhausted,
and they ate chicken. On that miserable
eighth day some bad fairy waved a wand, and the
chicken disappeared from the prairie. During the
entire day Conacher did not obtain a shot. Consequently
they went supperless to bed.</p>

<p>He was up at sunrise, ranging the prairie while the
girls slept. But with no luck. There was nothing
living in sight except the gophers who gained the
shelter of their burrows ere he could come close enough
to hope to hit them with his clumsy gun. In desperation
he did shoot at gophers at last, only to plug the
earth. When he returned to camp, the girls, having
heard the sound of his gun, awaited him with anticipatory
smiles, and he had the bitterness of showing them
his empty hands. There was no breakfast.</p>

<p>On this first morning it was easy to turn it into a
joke.</p>

<p>“Anyway, I’m sick of meat,” said Loseis.</p>

<p>“My people lak go ’ongry for awhile,” said Mary-Lou.
“Mak’ the big feed taste better bam-bye.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’ll save a lot of time,” said Conacher with
a sheepish grin. He felt responsible for their plight.</p>

<p>They set forth briskly enough; but were very glad
to rest when mid-morning came. All of them were
now feeling very painful gnawings, but they concealed
it from each other. Conacher prowled over the
prairie in vain. They listlessly resumed their march.</p>

<p>During the course of the afternoon they came unexpectedly
to the lip of a deep coulee with a trickle of
water in the bottom. To Conacher’s dismay it proved
to be flowing in a southerly direction. This was
exactly opposite to what he expected. It was against
all the theories as to the lay of this unexplored land,
and he was ready to despair. However, there was
nothing to do but to keep on the way they were going.</p>

<p>An hour later they crossed it again. The water
was now flowing north, and Conacher’s mind was
somewhat relieved. Upon this second crossing they
found more water than before in the streamlet, and a
fringe of spruce trees, the first grown trees they had
seen since leaving Blackburn’s River. They also
found, what was more important to them, berry-bushes,
and a patch of wild strawberries. Only the
strawberries were ripe. Before eating any, they carefully
collected them in their little cooking pot, and
scrupulously divided them. There was about a cupful
apiece.</p>

<p>The berries were deliciously refreshing; but they
seemed to have the effect of still further sharpening
the pangs of hunger. They searched far up and
down the coulee for more, but in vain. It was an isolated
patch of trees and bushes.</p>

<p>“Let us get on,” Conacher kept urging the girls.
“We must reach a game country before our strength
fails.”</p>

<p>They wearily climbed the steep side of the coulee to
the endless rolling prairie again, that they now hated.
On this day they suffered a keener pain from hunger
than during the days that followed. All three became
tight-lipped and silent. Their limbs were leaden; and
progress was painfully slow. Twice more they crossed
the coulee. No more trees or berries. It was now
evident that the general course of the little stream
was northwest, which was in line with Conacher’s calculations.
It was undoubtedly a tributary of the big
river they were seeking: but whether the river were
ten miles or a hundred miles further, it was impossible
to tell. It was exasperating in their fatigued condition
to climb in and out of the steep coulee so many times:
but even so they made better time than they could
have done by following it throughout its crazy windings.</p>

<p>Seeing more spruce trees, they descended into it to
spend the night, but found no berries here. They
heaped a great fire and made themselves soft beds of
spruce boughs: but their empty stomachs refused to be
assuaged by these luxuries. Mary-Lou cut three small
strips from the top of one of her worn-out moccasins,
and boiled them, and handed them around.</p>

<p>“Chew,” she said. “It will stop the pains anyhow.”</p>

<p>Afterwards a curious false strength seemed to come
to them. They felt no desire to sleep, but sat up for
hours around their fire under the spruces, talking animatedly
with flushed faces and bright eyes.</p>

<p>“When I was a kid,” said Conacher, “I had a grand-uncle
in New York, who was a great old high-liver.
Never thought about anything but eats. He knew all
the best restaurants in the city, and what was the
proper thing to order in each place. He took me out
to dinner a couple of times when I was a boy. Once
we went to Delmonico’s. I have never forgotten what
we ate that day. First oysters. I suppose you
don’t know oysters, Loseis. Well, they are the best
eating there is. Slip down your throat like velvet.
Then a thick soup that was called potage Mongole.
God knows what was in it. It was a combination
of all the most delicious flavors you ever knew.
Then there was something that was called Tournedos
Henri Quatre. It was like beef, but it was the sauce
that made all the difference. The French are wizards
for sauces. We ended up with mince pie; good old
American mince pie; and there’s nothing better! Oh,
what a feed that was!”</p>

<p>“The best thing I ever tasted,” said Loseis vivaciously,
“was roast pig. Three years ago Jim Cornwall
came through from the Crossing with dogs, and
brought my father a little frozen pig on his sled for
Christmas. We thawed him out and roasted him until
his hide crackled. Oh, my dear! the smell alone
would drive you crazy; and the taste was better than
anything in the world. I can taste him now! Do you
member, Mary-Lou?”</p>

<p>“I remember,” said Mary-Lou, closing her eyes. “I
did taste that pig meat. It was sweeter than young
porcupine; it was sweeter than moose-nose or the back-fat
of caribou; it was sweeter than all meat.”</p>

<p>“And do you remember?” asked Loseis, “when they
stuck the knife into him how a little stream of juicy
fat ran down?”</p>

<p>“We soaked it up with bread,” said Mary-Lou.</p>

<p>The subject was inexhaustible. They discussed it
with anxious, drawn, eager faces. It never occurred
to them to laugh at each other or at themselves.
When they finally slept they dreamed of feasting.</p>

<p>Another day of misery followed no different from
the day before, except that the pangs of hunger were
less sharp and more enervating. It was hard to keep
walking. It nearly broke Conacher’s heart to see the
boyish Loseis pressing on with set face, quite unconscious
of how she was staggering in her tracks. He
took the second gun from her. She fought like a little
spitfire to regain it, weeping out of anger and weakness.
Her anger smoldered all the rest of the day,
making the way even more bitter. Mary-Lou stood
starvation better than either of the whites. They
found another tantalizing patch of berries; and wasted
hours looking for more. As on the night before,
their supper consisted of a small strip of boiled hide
apiece.</p>

<p>On the third day of starvation it seemed a wonder
that they were able to move at all. Nevertheless they
staggered on for a few miles. To add to their miseries
it rained copiously; and their blankets soaked up some
additional pounds of water. All day a division existed
between Conacher and Loseis that was harder to bear
than starvation. It was due to nothing in the world
but compassion. It made each tender heart rage to
behold the misery of the other. Especially Conacher’s,
because he told himself that no woman ought
to be subjected to such an ordeal. He supposed from
Loseis’ black looks that she was blaming him for having
led her into this, and he was ready to blow his
brains out.</p>

<p>The little stream having received a tributary from
the south, flowed with increased speed and volume. It
now held a fairly straight course for the northwest;
and it became evident that the whole country was
sloping gently in that direction. The walls of the
coulee gradually became higher; in the bottom it was
now continuously wooded; but they felt too weak to
climb down for a few berries. These changes in the
country suggested that they were approaching the bottom
of the watershed, and at midday from a rise in
the prairie, Conacher at last beheld a blue shadow
athwart the westerly horizon which indicated the valley
of a considerable river. It seemed like a mockery
now. It was a good twenty-five miles distant, and in
their weakened state that was half a world away.</p>

<p>At the end of the day they made a detour from the
coulee to visit a small slough and a poplar bluff that
they had marked from a rise. It was a likely place
to find bear. There was no bear, but the water of the
slough was sweet, and they determined to spend the
night in that spot. Will it be our last camp? Conacher
thought with dread in his heart. The sky was
still threatening, and he constructed an inclined thatch
of poplar leaves, with a fire in front for the girls.
They chewed their strips of boiled hide. This finished
one moccasin, except for the ragged lower part, that
Mary-Lou had bound round her foot. Afterwards,
when Loseis, with a cold face, turned to seek her blanket,
Conacher felt that he could bear no more.</p>

<p>“Loseis .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. !” he murmured heart-brokenly.</p>

<p>Mary-Lou vanished away amongst the little trees.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Loseis coldly.</p>

<p>“I cannot bear it .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. !”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“Your look! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Forgive me!”</p>

<p>“For what must I forgive you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Whatever it is that I have done
that angers you. For getting you into this scrape.”</p>

<p>Her face looked very small and pinched. It worked
curiously with anger. Her voice came unnaturally
sharp: “Forgive you! What sort of talk is this?
Are you trying to make me feel worse than I feel
already? Aren’t you satisfied with doing most of the
work, and walking twice as far to hunt, and carrying
a double load, but you must make me feel what a burden
I am by asking me to forgive you!”</p>

<p>He only dimly understood the torment of this
proud nature. “But Loseis .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. !” he protested,
staring, “this is foolishness .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. !”</p>

<p>“Of course! of course! of course! I am a fool!
That is well understood!”</p>

<p>“Listen to me,” he said doggedly. “You say I
carry too heavy a burden. Why add to it with your
cold and angry looks? The weight of two guns is
nothing to me. It is your hard eyes that break me
down.”</p>

<p>Loseis’ reply was to burst into tears.</p>

<p>He took her in his arms. “Don’t you love me any
more?” he whispered.</p>

<p>She crept within his arms, but she abused him still.
“You fool! it is because I love you so, that I am always
angry. It drives me wild to think that I should
spoil the life of a man like you!”</p>

<p>“But that’s nonsense!” said Conacher. “I am nothing
in particular. A man only has one life. How could
he spend it better? We shall go together. What else
matters .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Don’t you feel better now?”</p>

<p>“A little bit,” she admitted. “But to-morrow I shall
be angry with you again. You are too good and patient.
If you turned hateful I should feel better. It
would even things up a little.”</p>

<p>“You’re a funny one!” he murmured.</p>

<p>However, the air <span class='it'>was</span> cleared; and they rolled up in
their blankets with a bit of comfort at their hearts.</p>

<p>When Conacher awoke next morning a light rain
was drifting down. He pulled his blanket closer
around him. Lying there like that one did not suffer;
it was warm; the pangs of hunger did not make themselves
felt; a comfortable numbness filled the frame.
But the thought of getting up was hideous. For a
long time he lay struggling with it. Useless for him to
tell himself that he was the head of the party; the
girls were dependent on him; it was up to him to find
them food; he felt that he <span class='it'>could not</span> get up; the effort
was too great.</p>

<p>In the end he had to get up. The first few moments
were the worst. He stood in the rain, swaying and
nauseated, a black mist swimming before his eyes.
Each morning it was much worse. If he could conquer
this first weakness, he could go on through the day—but
to-morrow morning! He shook that thought
away. He forced himself to walk up and down, supporting
himself by the little trees. After awhile he
felt better. Picking up his gun, he started on his hopeless
circuit of the bluff.</p>

<p>He paused in front of the little shelter he had
constructed for the girls. They slept. Loseis was
lying with her head pillowed on Mary-Lou’s shoulder
like a child. In her weakness she looked entirely
the child, the sick child. At the sight of those transparent
cheeks and bluish eyelids, Conacher’s breast
was wrung with agony. The worst of overcoming
the physical weakness was, that one then began to
think again, with horrible clearness. How could he
ask this exhausted child to go on any further? She
was dearer to him than his life. Would it not be
kinder to end her sufferings while she slept? She
opened her eyes, and smiled at him enchantingly.
That smile capped his agony. Swallowing the groan
that was forced up by his breast, he smiled back, and
staggered on.</p>

<p>Like all the prairie sloughs, this one lay in a dish-like
depression surrounded by a shallow rim of grass.
Conacher had made half his round of the bluff, when
over this rim at a distance of about a hundred yards
appeared a lumbering black body of an astonishing
bigness. For an instant he thought his senses were
failing him; he began to tremble violently; but he
quickly realized that it was a veritable bear. A bear’s
eye-sight is not very keen, and the animal had not
seen him. He drew back amongst the little trees,
struggling to control his excitement. You <span class='it'>can not</span> miss
him! he kept telling himself.</p>

<p>The bear was evidently making for the bluff to
breakfast off poplar bark. Conacher realized with a
pang that he was directly in the wind of the animal.
The bear was in no hurry. He turned aside to snuff
and scratch at the roots of a clump of roses. He
was the largest black bear that Conacher had ever
seen. The big head was dwarfed by his mighty rump.
His black pelt was grayed with moisture. The man’s
mouth watered ridiculously. The bear turned towards
him, and his heart began to thump. Then the
animal changed his mind, and sauntered around the
rim of the bench. Conacher, stepping with infinite
care, kept pace with him amongst the little trees.</p>

<p>The bear disappeared over the edge of the rim, and
Conacher’s heart almost broke. Should I go after
him? he asked himself. No! he is bound to come to
the bluff and the slough. The animal reappeared and
hope flared up anew. He was heading towards the
bluff again. He was no longer directly in Conacher’s
wind, consequently the chance of getting him was better.
But the deliberation of the beast well-nigh maddened
the man. Bruin stood gazing off to the east as
if he were debating the choice between this and some
other feeding ground. He sat up on his haunches, and
licked his paws. Finally he came lumbering towards
the trees in a businesslike manner. Conacher raised
his gun.</p>

<p>Before the bear had made half the distance that
separated them, though Conacher had not moved, the
animal’s mysterious instinct warned him of the presence
of danger. He stopped with a woof! of alarm,
and turning in his tracks, galloped back for the shelter
of the rim. Conacher fired. The bear’s broad beam
offered him a goodly mark, and he knew by the tremor
that went through the animal that he had hit him:
but it was not in a vulnerable spot. He galloped on
without a pause. He disappeared over the encircling
rim of grass. A voice seemed to cry inside Conacher:
“You have lost your last chance!”</p>

<p>He found strength to run as if he had not been
starved for four days. As he topped the rise, he
saw the bear lying in the grass a hundred feet away;
and a great, calm thankfulness filled his breast. It
was all right! The animal was not dead, but disabled
in his hind quarters. He lay with his head between his
paws awaiting the end. Conacher dispatched him with
a bullet through the brain.</p>

<p>Crying out: “A bear! I’ve got him!” Conacher
dropped to his knees, and started instanter to skin
his prey. Presently Mary-Lou who was more skillful
at this job than he, relieved him. Loseis stood looking
on like a happy little ghost. They could not wait
to skin the bear entire; but cut off a piece of meat,
and ran back to the fire with it.</p>

<p>Conacher kept saying over and over like an old
woman: “Mind! Mind! Only a little piece at first,
or it will make you sick!”</p>

<p>“If there is meat, why not eat?” grumbled Mary-Lou.</p>

<p>Nevertheless she obeyed; and at first only three tiny
pieces were set upon pointed sticks to roast over the
fire. It may be guessed that they were not <span class='it'>very</span> well
cooked before they were eaten. Conacher and Loseis
nibbled them to make them go as far as possible.
Mary-Lou saw no sense at all in this proceeding, but
loyally followed their example.</p>

<p>“Is that all?” said Loseis wistfully.</p>

<p>“Mary-Lou could put some small pieces in the pot
and boil them,” suggested Conacher. “The soup
would be good for you.”</p>

<p>“Soup!” said Loseis, making a face.</p>

<p>“Well, by and by we will roast another little piece.
To-morrow, if you feel all right, you can eat all you
want.”</p>

<p>There was no question of moving on that day.
They ate a little more; slept; and ate again. Conacher
and Loseis sat happily side by side under the shelter
of the leaves, watching Mary-Lou cut off thin slabs
of the meat, and hang them in the smoke of the fire.
The Indian girl also contrived moccasins for herself
out of squares of the hide.</p>

<p>Next morning they awoke with bounding pulses
as if they had never known what it was to starve. At
breakfast time they feasted without stint. Their
cheeks seemed to have filled out over night; their eyes
were bright; their teeth gleaming. There was something
so comical in the sight of this abrupt transformation,
that they continually burst out laughing
with their mouths full at the sight of each other’s
joy.</p>

<p>They set out again laden with as much meat as they
could carry.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='287' id='Page_287'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXIV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>DOWNSTREAM</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>A</span>s</span> they descended by imperceptible degrees towards
the river, they could no longer make out
the line of its valley ahead. The bald-headed prairie
now began to take on a parklike aspect. Groups of
graceful, full-grown poplars with their greenish yellow
bark became more and more numerous, gradually
leading them into a well-grown forest of aspen trees,
interspersed with spruce. But there were still grassy
openings of all sizes, from pretty glades to miniature
prairies. Through the trackless forest it was very
slow going; giant raspberry bushes, now in blossom,
barred the way; rotting trunks lay prone in every direction;
and vivid moss treacherously masked the holes
where the ancient stems had rotted clean out of the
ground.</p>

<p>As the afternoon wore on, and there was no end to
this, no sign of any river, a feeling of discouragement
attacked them again. Could they have been mistaken?
And then without warning, they issued out of the trees
on to a grassy knoll; and there, with a magnificent effect
of dramatic surprise, lay the long-sought river at
their very feet.</p>

<p>It was a thrilling moment. That view, so cunningly
masked by the belt of forest, was one of the finest
views imaginable. It was a first-class river. It flowed
in the bottom of a valley at least six hundred feet
deep, and no more than half a mile across from rim
to rim. From the opposite rim, the prairie rolled on
to the horizon. It was not so much a valley as a
deep, clean gash in the prairie. The side upon which
they stood was mantled with the deep green of spruce,
while the other side rolled up in fantastic knobs and
terraces of buffalo grass.</p>

<p>The river poured a smooth, yellowish green flood
through the bottom of this mighty trough; just the
color of poplar bark. It was broken by several high
islands, covered with spruce trees, which stemmed the
current like majestic ships. The point upon which
they stood was on the outside of a great bend, and
they could look far up-stream, where the river seemed
to flatten out, and to issue dazzling and molten from
the afternoon sun itself.</p>

<p>Conacher’s first thought was: “Plenty of water!
I’ll be able to make a raft. We’ll have some easy
days now.”</p>

<p>They gazed at the noble prospect with full hearts.
Conacher in particular was bursting with pride. He
felt like the creator of that river, because they had
found it where he had said it would be.</p>

<p>“We happen to have hit it just right,” he said with a
transparent air of carelessness. “In years to come
when there is a trail it will strike the river here.
Above here, you see, it flows east of north, and at this
point it swings around to the westward. That agrees
with the Indian reports. It is the only river east of
the Rockies that has a westward trend.”</p>

<p>“It is too beautiful to be called the Mud River,”
said Loseis.</p>

<p>“After this it shall be Laurentia’s River.”</p>

<p>“Suppose there are rapids,” suggested the matter-of-fact
Mary-Lou.</p>

<p>“It will probably flow smooth for two hundred
miles,” said Conacher. “Then it will strike the limestone
outcrop that crosses the whole country. We’ll
find rapids, maybe cascades, there.”</p>

<p>“And we are the first whites to see it!” murmured
Loseis.</p>

<p>“If I can bring him a good sketch map of it, it will
put my boss in a good humor,” said Conacher.</p>

<p>They made their way down to the water’s edge;
and chose a camping spot on a curious tongue of land
pointing downstream. At the highest stage of water
it was an island; but it was now connected with the
shore by a bar of dried mud. On one side of them the
resistless brown flood swept down silently, its silken
surface etched with eddies; on the other side there was
a quiet back-water which Conacher said would be ideal
for constructing the raft. He spent the remaining
hours of daylight in searching for the three big, dead
trees that he required for that purpose.</p>

<p>They slept in great comfort on heaps of spruce
boughs, with a generous fire between them. Even in
July the nights were cold. In the silence of the night
they discovered that the smoothly flowing river had
a voice. It was neither a roar nor a whisper, but partook
of the nature of both sounds. Though scarcely
audible, it was tremendous; like the breathing and
stirring of a mighty bed-fellow.</p>

<p>The entire following day was devoted to the construction
of the raft. Conacher cut down his trees;
lopped off the branches; and chopped the trunks in
two. He then launched his logs, and floated them
together. During the earlier stages of his labor, he
was often obliged to wade thigh deep into the icy
water. Since he had neither spikes to fasten the logs,
nor rope to lash them together, he was forced patiently
to burn holes in them with his ramrod, heated
in the fire. Twenty-four such holes had to be burned;
and twelve neatly fitting wooden pegs shaped with the
ax. Two short lengths were laid across the six logs
and pegged down. The peg at each corner was
allowed to stick up a few inches. A flooring of poles
was then laid on the crosspieces to keep the passengers
and their slender baggage dry. These poles were not
fastened down, but were held in place by the pegs at
each corner. Conacher’s last act was to burn a hole
in each of the outside logs into which he drove a
stout forked branch to serve as a rowlock. The oars
were merely small spruce poles flattened with the ax
at the broad end.</p>

<p>The builder surveyed his completed effort with a
pride that was difficult to conceal. “After all this
work,” he said with his offhand air, “I shall be good
and sore if we have to abandon it in a few miles.”</p>

<p>“It is beautiful!” said Loseis.</p>

<p>For a touch of bravura Conacher made a little
hearth of clay tiled with flat stones on one end of his
raft; and laid a fire ready to light. “So we can boil
our meat as we travel,” he explained.</p>

<p>“It is like a steamboat!” said Loseis.</p>

<p>They turned in early; and were ready to push off
soon after sunrise the following morning. This was
the fourteenth morning after their departure from the
slough where their enemies had turned back. The
raft proved to possess ample buoyancy; they could
move about on it with a certain freedom. The floor
of poles held them safely above danger of a wetting.
Mary-Lou lighted the fire, and put the breakfast on to
cook.</p>

<p>Loseis and Conacher sculled out of the back-water.
At the foot of the island the current seized them as in
a giant hand and drew them along. They took their
oars inboard. There was nothing further to do. The
tendency of the current itself was to draw them into
the center of the stream, and keep them there. They
sat down on their blankets to survey the scenery. The
raft gyrated slowly in the eddies, giving them views
up and down stream without so much as having to
turn their heads.</p>

<p>“This is better than walking,” said Conacher.</p>

<p>Loseis agreed that it was; nevertheless she looked
with some trepidation to see what each new bend of
the unknown river had to show.</p>

<p>Conacher assured her on the word of a geologist
that as long as it ran between dirt banks there could
be no serious obstruction to navigation; when rocks
appeared, then look out! He had note-book and compass
out to make memoranda of its course. He calculated
that the current was running about five miles
an hour.</p>

<p>The sun was hot to-day; basking deliciously in its
rays, the girl fell into a comfortable doze. The scenery
was beautiful and monotonous; they looked at it,
only partly aware of what they were looking at, a half
smile fixed on their lips. Thus they recuperated from
the fatigues of the past few days. Since the raft did
not move through the water, but with the water, it
came to seem as if it was not moving at all. The raft
was the fixed point, and the shores were being slowly
rolled past them like a panorama on great spools.</p>

<p>This pleasant dream was rudely broken into by the
sound of a hoarse roar downstream.</p>

<p>“Rapid!” said Mary-Lou, moving towards an oar.</p>

<p>Loseis looked reproachfully at Conacher.</p>

<p>They edged the raft close inshore where they could
land quickly if need be.</p>

<p>“Let’s have a look at it before you call me a liar,”
said Conacher.</p>

<p>Rounding the outside of a bend, they came in view
of the white horses leaping below. An exclamation of
fear broke from the girls. Conacher caught hold of a
fallen tree to stay their progress while he studied the
white water.</p>

<p>“Nothing but a riffle,” he announced. “Its bark is
worse than its bite. This is a sharper bend than usual,
and it’s just the water backing up on the outside that
makes all the fuss. Notice that all the waves are
regular and unbroken. Deep water. It will be perfectly
safe to run it if you are willing.”</p>

<p>“All right if you say so,” said Loseis.</p>

<p>They cast off from their tree. Conacher and Mary-Lou
each stood up with an oar, and Loseis crouched
behind them.</p>

<p>“Head for the roughest part near the shore,” said
Conacher, “and keep her straight; that’s all.”</p>

<p>Their hearts beat fast as the shores began to slip
by with ever-increasing swiftness. The voice of the
rapid was like that of a ravening beast. There is no
other feeling quite like that upon the brink of a
rapid. The feeling is: No power on earth can save
me from it now—well, what the hell! They were
gripped by an exquisite fear. Finally the heavy raft
wriggled over the first and the biggest of those
strange, fixed billows and stuck her nose in the trough.
A sheet of spray flew back over them, whereupon they
were seized by a mad exhilaration, and all three yelled
like demons. The raft bucked over the short, steep
billows like a rogue horse. Conacher and Mary-Lou
were forced to their knees; and the latter lost her oar.
A moment later they found themselves in smooth
water, roaring with laughter.</p>

<p>As soon as they had eaten their supper that night,
they pushed off again. The girls slept while Conacher
watched throughout the long twilight. The sunset
glow alternated with the cold eastern sky as the raft
waltzed gracefully in the eddies. They grounded
her on a bar during the few hours of darkness; and
at dawn they pushed off again; the girls watching now
while Conacher slept. He awakened in the sunshine
to find them laughing at the antics of the bears on the
steep banks.</p>

<p>For three days they traveled in this pleasant fashion.
Mooseberries and black currants were ripening
now. The bushes grew thickly along the edges of the
water and wherever there were berries there were
bears. Drifting down silently on the raft, Conacher
could always get a shot in the early mornings. The
berries made a welcome change from a diet of meat
exclusively.</p>

<p>As they traveled north the steep high banks gradually
flattened down, and the current of the river slackened.
Finally the high banks disappeared altogether;
they could see nothing over the tops of the poplars and
pines that lined the water’s edge. The course of the
stream became very tortuous, and progress was slow.</p>

<p>“We’re evidently coming to something,” Conacher
remarked. “This country is a vast belt of silt deposited
by the river as the result of some obstruction
ahead.”</p>

<p>On the fourth day the obstruction appeared in the
form of a low wall of limestone through which the
river had finally succeeded in forcing a passage. The
rock walls were but three or four feet high, and the
river slipped between them very swiftly and smoothly
with a curious growling sound. On the other side the
whole character of the country was changed. Rock
appeared everywhere; and the lush vegetation of the
prairies was gone.</p>

<p>They had not gone far before they came to a rapid,
a real rapid this one, with great bowlders sticking up
out of it, that tore the current to white tatters. Landing
at a safe distance above, they walked down along
the shore to see if there was a possible channel
through. Conacher was naturally averse to abandoning
the raft which had cost him such pains.</p>

<p>After a little study, he pointed out to the girls how
it might be done. “It would be foolish, though, to
risk the guns and ammunition and the ax. You girls
carry the things along the shore, and I’ll take the raft
down.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you hit a rock?” said Loseis, paling.</p>

<p>“Why, I’d get a ducking, that’s all.”</p>

<p>He accomplished the feat without accident. To the
watching Loseis he made an extraordinarily gallant
figure, standing on the raft, braced and swaying to
every movement; his resolute glance fixed ahead, while
he paddled madly to steer it around obstructions.</p>

<p>In the next rapid, an hour or so later, he was not so
fortunate. The raft, in spite of his efforts, slid up on
a submerged shelf of rock, and rearing on end, flung
the loose poles in every direction. Conacher, jumping
clear of the wreck, went down with the current. The
frame of the raft followed him down; and he contrived
to bring it ashore below; and the paddle too.
With some new poles the raft was as good as ever.</p>

<p>However, the rapids seemed to grow successively
worse; and Loseis forbade him to risk his neck in the
next one. They sent the raft down empty. After a
mad voyage, battered back and forth on the bowlders,
it came through minus its poles, somewhat loosened
up but still practicable. They then camped for the
night.</p>

<p>On the following day they were nosing along close
to the shore with the disquieting roar of a rapid in
their ears, but apparently still at some distance. The
view down river was cut off by a low, stony hill,
sparsely covered with trees, around the base of which
the stream wound its way. Suddenly Conacher perceived
that the current was sucking ominously along-shore.
That part of the shore was much cumbered
with old down trees. He drove the raft into the naked
branches.</p>

<p>“Grab hold!” he said sharply to the girls.</p>

<p>They missed the first tree. Fine beads of perspiration
broke out on Conacher’s forehead. He perceived
that in a dozen yards the raft would be beyond his
control. He seized the next overhanging branch, and
wound a leg around his improvised oarlock to hold the
raft. The girls were now fully alive to the danger.
Mary-Lou climbed into the tree, and Loseis swiftly
passed her their precious few belongings. When
everything was ashore Conacher let the raft go, and it
lumbered around the point with surprising swiftness.</p>

<p>“That’s the last of it,” said Conacher sadly.</p>

<p>They climbed the stony hill. As they rounded the
top, a hoarse, throaty bellowing buffeted their ears;
and a moment later a wild welter of white water was
spread before their eyes. They had seen nothing like
this. After rounding the hill the stream straightened
out, and narrowing down to a quarter of its usual
width tumbled down as steeply as a flight of stairs between
high wooded banks. The impression of power
was overwhelming. The water was forced into great,
regular billows which looked to be fifteen feet high.
Each billow or ridge of water converged to a point in
the middle; and the effect as one looked downstream
was of a series of blunt white arrows pointing up.
No boat could have lived in that turmoil. The raft—or
what was left of it—was already out of sight.
The three looked at each other with scared and thankful
faces. A close call!</p>

<p>They now had to adjust their minds to traveling on
foot again—and this would not be anything like the
rolling prairie! The first thing was to roll up their
packs, and strap them on their backs. They then descended
into the gorge; but found it impossible to
make headway along the steep side, impeded with
stones and down timber. They were forced to climb
a hundred feet or so to level ground. This was
scarcely better. Only those who have tried to make
their way through a trackless virgin forest can appreciate
the difficulties that faced them in the shape of
undergrowth, fallen trees and holes in the earth. The
débris of ages was heaped in their path. They guided
themselves by the sound of the cascade upon their
left.</p>

<p>In a mile or so (which had all the effect of ten) the
river fell quiet again, and they pushed back to its
bank. It was an open question which was the more
difficult going. Along the edge of the stream the dead
timber brought down by the freshets was left stranded
in inextricable tangles. Conacher finally chose a
course parallel with the river bank, and a few yards
back from the edge. Here they were at least sure of
a supply of water. All day long it was a case of climbing
over obstacles or through them or chopping a way.
Heart-breaking work. They camped while it was still
early, completely tired out.</p>

<p>For day after day this continued. There was no
lack of dead timber to make another raft: but the
rapids followed each other in such close succession
that it seemed a waste of time. It was exasperating
to have to undergo such crushing labor with the
stream running alongside ready to carry them in the
desired direction. “If I only had a dug-out!” Conacher
groaned a dozen times a day. But even if they
could have taken the time to make a dug-out, there
was no suitable timber in that stony land. The noise
of their progress through the bush scared away all
game; and they would soon have gone hungry, had
it not been for the smoked meat which Mary-Lou
had thoughtfully provided. Presently this gave out,
and they had to lay over for a day, while Conacher
hunted a bear, along the river. Their clothes were in
rags.</p>

<p>In ten days Conacher figured that they had made
about fifty miles: but this was pure guesswork. It
was now within two or three days of the time when
the surveying outfit was due at the mouth of the Mud
River.</p>

<p>The three travelers were sitting gloomily on the
shore of the river in a spot where it flowed as
smoothly and prettily between poplar and birch-covered
shores as a river in a civilized land where
picnics might be held. The view downstream was
blocked by a graceful island. Suddenly around that
island came poking the nose of a birch-bark canoe with
a single paddler.</p>

<p>To those three that sight was like a blow between
the eyes. They glanced fearfully at each other for
confirmation. It was a month since they had seen
others of their kind. They stared at the approaching
canoe with open mouths. Then Conacher jumped to
his feet and hailed. The paddler was arrested in mid-motion.
He was no less startled by the meeting than
they. After a moment he came paddling gingerly towards
them. They saw that it was a white man, an
odd, withered, brownish specimen, whose skin was all
of a color with his battered hat, and faded khaki
jacket.</p>

<p>He grounded his canoe gently in the mud, and
stepped out. An old smoked pioneer with a comically
injured look which never varied. They shook hands
gravely all around before a word was spoken.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” demanded Conacher and Loseis
simultaneously.</p>

<p>“Bill Mitchell,” he replied with the shrug and
the aggrieved look that were characteristic of him.
“Who the hell are you?”</p>

<p>“I am Conacher of the surveying outfit, and this is
Miss Blackburn.”</p>

<p>“Blackburn’s daughter!” exclaimed the old man
with widening eyes. “Do you mean to tell me you’ve
come down from Blackburn’s Post this away!”</p>

<p>Conacher was not anxious to go into lengthy explanations.
“We’re expecting to join my outfit on the
Sinclair River,” he said quickly. “How far are we
from the Sinclair?”</p>

<p>“Matter of ten mile. There’s one rapid between.”</p>

<p>“Well, thank God!” cried Conacher fervently.
“Have you seen the surveying outfit?”</p>

<p>“Spelled with them three days since,” replied the
old man. “They’re working up-stream slow. Ought
to be off the mouth of the Mud River some time to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Conacher and Loseis exchanged a beaming look.
All their troubles rolled away. “Well, we didn’t
manage that so badly,” said the former, conceitedly.</p>

<p>“What are you doing here?” Conacher asked of
the old man.</p>

<p>“Me?” he answered with his disgruntled look;
“what do you think I’m doin’? I’m prospectin’ this
river. It ain’t never been prospected.”</p>

<p>“But when you get above the rapids it’s a prairie
river,” said Conacher. “We came through three hundred
miles of it, and there’s likely three hundred miles
more above that.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll work up to the mountains,” said the old
man undisturbed.</p>

<p>“You fellows ought to study a little geology before
you break your hearts with a journey like this,” said
Conacher nettled. “Nobody has ever found any
amount of gold on the easterly slope of the Rockies.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe this river comes right through the mountains
like the Spirit and the Sinclair,” said the old
fellow obstinately.</p>

<p>“Look at it!” said Conacher. “There’s damned
little snow water in that. It’s pure prairie mud.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I’ve come so far I might as well go see,”
he said calmly. “I got all summer. All I want is to
get into the mountains before I go into winter quarters.”</p>

<p>Conacher gave him up. He described the upper
reaches of the river for his benefit. “How will you
get your canoe around the big fall?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Chop a trail through the bush, and then come back
for it,” said the old man calmly. “It don’t weigh but
forty pound.”</p>

<p>Looking into his canoe they perceived that his
entire worldly goods consisted of three bags of flour,
a box of ammunition, and a slim dunnage bag of odds
and ends. It appeared that his gun was of the same
caliber as that carried by Conacher. The old man
looked at the other’s still partly filled ammunition belt
desirously.</p>

<p>“You’ll be joining your outfit to-morrow,” he said
suggestively.</p>

<p>“Tell you what I’ll do,” said Conacher. “Cache
your flour here, and carry us down to the mouth of
the river and it shall be yours.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mind ef I do,” said Bill Mitchell.</p>

<p>After the labors of the past days that last ten miles
was like riding in a taxi. They whisked the light
canoe around the rapid with no trouble at all. Below,
the Mud River widened out and found its way into
the Sinclair through a miniature delta amongst low,
grassy islands covered with gigantic cottonwood trees
that created a dim green twilight below. Mitchell
landed them on a pine-clad point that looked down a
reach of the greater river, several miles long. The
old man did not get out.</p>

<p>“Won’t you spell with us?” asked Conacher politely.</p>

<p>The pioneer rubbed his hairy chin, and squinted
down river as if he had perceived something important
down there. “I guess not,” he drawled.
“Got to be gettin’ along.” With a casual good-by, he
pushed off and resumed his solitary journey up-stream.</p>

<p>“What a strange creature!” murmured Loseis.</p>

<p>“It was the presence of a lady which embarrassed
him,” said Conacher. “He confided to me that he
had not seen a white girl in seven years.”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>Twenty-four hours later it was Conacher who perceived,
down at the end of the long reach, the flash
of wet paddles in the sun.</p>

<p>“Here they come!” he cried.</p>

<p>The two girls ran to his side. For a long time they
could make out nothing but the regular flash of several
paddles like heliograph signals. Finally four
little black objects took shape down river. The
watchers filled with a mounting excitement that became
painful to bear; their breasts were like dynamos
humming higher and higher until the pitch became unendurable.
They had looked forward to this meeting
through such hardships and perils! there had been
so many days when they despaired of accomplishing
it! But here they came at last; men of their own kind;
friends; rescuers. Conacher and Loseis felt as if
their hearts would crack with joy.</p>

<p>“My God! how astonished they’ll be!” said Conacher
shakily.</p>

<p>The impulse to make the most of their friends’ astonishment
was irresistible; and the three drew back
under cover of the trees. Soon they were able to distinguish
that the approaching party consisted of three
white men and eight Indians traveling in three big
dug-outs, and a rough, narrow scow that was being
poled along close to the shore. Finally Conacher recognized
his especial friend.</p>

<p>“Alec Jordan!” he murmured with a tight, warm
feeling around the heart. “Good old Alec!”</p>

<p>They saw that the oncoming boats intended to make
a landing directly at their feet. It was an inevitable
camping-place. The three dug-outs grounded almost
simultaneously on the shingle. As the white men rose
in their places, Conacher stepped out from among the
trees.</p>

<p>“Hello, fellows!” he said in a casual voice.</p>

<p>They stared at him completely awe-struck. “My
God!” they murmured in hushed tones; and looked at
each other. The Indians in the scow pushed off in
a panic and floated away on the current.</p>

<p>Conacher, pale with excitement, but grinning
widely, stepped down the bank. “I’m no ghost!” he
cried. He marched up to Langmuir, the head of the
party. “I want to report for duty,” he said simply.</p>

<p>“Report .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for duty!” stammered Langmuir
clownishly.</p>

<p>Jordan was the first to recover from the shock. He
flung his arms around his friend. “Conacher! Conacher!
<span class='it'>Conacher!</span>” he yelled, shaking him violently
as if to make certain that he was flesh and blood.</p>

<p>“How in hell did you get here?” demanded Langmuir
in a voice of extreme bitterness, which was not
really bitter.</p>

<p>“Been waitin’ for you since yesterday,” said Conacher
airily. “I cut across the prairie north of Blackburn’s
Post, and came down the Mud River to head
you off. Got a map of the river for you, chief, such
as it is.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m damned!” said Langmuir solemnly. And
the others echoed him in varying tones: “I’m
<span class='it'>damned</span>!”</p>

<p>Conacher was not yet done surprising them. As
they turned to climb the bank, he said somewhat nervously:
“I’ve got a couple of guests with me.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>Loseis stepped into view above. In breeches and
Stetson, smiling merrily, yet a little apprehensively,
too, she made an enchanting figure. The rents in her
clothes, the marks of hardship in her face, only set
off the bravery of her spirit. To those white men so
long parted from the women of their race, it was like
a miracle.</p>

<p>“Miss Blackburn, gentlemen,” Conacher sang out.
“Mr. Langmuir; Mr. Jordan; Mr. Seely.”</p>

<p>They snatched off their hats. “Pleased to meet
you,” they mumbled sheepishly.</p>

<p>“Merciful Heaven! am I awake or dreaming!”
Langmuir murmured to himself.</p>

<div><span class='pageno' title='305' id='Page_305'></span><h1>CHAPTER XXV<br/> <span class='sub-head'>CONCLUSION</span></h1></div>

<p class='noindent'><span class='lead-in'><span class='dropcap'>T</span>he</span> meeting at the mouth of the Mud River was
the beginning of a still longer journey for Loseis.
But it was never again allowed to become an arduous
one for her. All hands, white and red, joined together
to smooth her way. She reigned the undisputed Princess
of Langmuir’s party, holding them in subjection
with her smile.</p>

<p>After a laborious month ascending the Sinclair,
plotting the river and collecting geological data and
specimens, they came to a lonely trading outpost on
the Pacific side of the mountains, called Pinnacle
House. It stood amidst wild and beautiful surroundings
in a deep green valley between parallel ranges.
The pointed limestone peaks gave it its name. How
strange it was to find such homely old friends as cabbages,
onions and potatoes growing in the trader’s
garden!</p>

<p>The trader was away on his usual summer journey
to bring in supplies; and they found his house occupied
at the moment by the Reverend Patrick Geogehagen,
a famous character of the country, better known as
“Patsy.” Patsy was a brawny, bright-eyed wrestler
for the Lord, with cherry-colored cheeks, and a
spreading black beard that saved him the trouble of
wearing a necktie. It was his self-imposed duty to
visit and minister to those tribes of Indians who were
too poor, too disreputable or too far away to attract
the attention of the regular missionaries.</p>

<p>When they hailed him he was cleaning his gun at
the door of the single log shack that served both for
store and dwelling at Pinnacle House, and there was
nothing in his rough dress to indicate his calling.
When he introduced himself, Conacher looked at
Loseis with a quick, smiling question and Loseis answered
it with a quick, smiling assent. Conacher
whispered shamefacedly to Patsy, who thereupon
gave him a frightful clap on the back, and roared:</p>

<p>“Delighted, my boy!”</p>

<p>Conacher took Langmuir aside. The chief wagged
his head in perplexity; and scratched it, and grumbled:</p>

<p>“What the deuce, Conny! Such a thing was never
heard of in a party engaged on field work! What
will it look like in my report? Oh, Lord! think of
the explanations I will be called on to make to all
the old women in the Department!”</p>

<p>“Why should it appear in the report?” said Conacher.
“It’s none of the Government’s business.
Have I been any the worse worker during the past
month?”</p>

<p>“No, no! you’ve worked like two! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Hm!
that’s so. Why should it appear? .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Go ahead,
my boy; and God bless you! I bags to give the bride
away.”</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, it <span class='it'>did not</span> appear. The report
of Langmuir’s party is filed away with many others
equally decorous, and nobody in the Government
ever suspected that they entertained a Princess
during the summer and celebrated a wedding.</p>

<p>There were no wedding garments in the outfit but a
great shaving, shearing, washing and brushing-up took
place. The fellows decorated the single room of the
cabin with spruce branches and flowers from the
mountain side. Loseis had to be married in breeches
and boots because it was all she had. At least her
clothes were neatly mended by this time. Her smile
was the smile of a happy bride; and nobody was
aware of any incongruity. Conacher looked as frightened
as every well-disposed man is supposed to be at
his wedding; and large fat tears rolled down the
bridesmaid’s dark cheeks. Up to the moment of donning
his vestments Patsy joked outrageously; he then
became the priest of God. In a free and natural
state of society these abrupt contrasts are perfectly
well understood. Nobody thought the less of Patsy
because he was a man as well as a priest.</p>

<p>Patsy and Mary-Lou conspired together to produce
the wedding-feast; and the result, considering
the meager resources of Pinnacle House, astonished
everybody. They may have been short of the fixings,
but they had five kinds of game and fish; and
to polish off with, a gigantic roly-poly pudding stuffed
with currant jam.</p>

<p>The speeches were no better nor worse than usual.
Patsy said in part:</p>

<p>“Sure, friends, I shall look back on this as one of
the happiest days of me life! This morning I was
not aware that you people as much as existed; this
afternoon you are established as the friends of me
heart, and shall never be absent from me heart while
it beats. Even parsons get discouraged sometimes,
though none of ’em would ever admit it but a renegade
like me. This mornin’ I was sittin’ at the door of
this house trying to make up my mind whether to
visit the scrofulous Louchoux Indians to the northeast,
or the flea-bitten Sikannis to the southeast, and feelin’
ready to consign ’em both to perdition. Sure, in all the
world there is not such another lousy, thieving, crack-brained,
worthless congregation as me own, I was telling
meself, when along you came with this lovely girl
to remind me of the existence of beauty in the world,
and this bold lad to refresh me with the sight of
manliness! Would I marry them? says he, blushing.
Would I marry them? I was ready to throw my cap
in the air at such a chance! That is jam in the life
of a forgotten missionary. I consider that in joining
these two I have performed the best act of me life.
The country ought to profit by it. Here’s to the
newly married pair! May they live long and obey the
scriptural injunction!”</p>

<p>To which Conacher answered:</p>

<p>“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Er .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you fellows and the Reverend
Patsy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I rise to say .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. er .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. that is, to
thank you .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I’m not much of a speaker .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>“No?” queried a sarcastic voice.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Jordan. You can laugh. I’ll
live to see you married yet.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Where was I?
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I only wanted to say, only you interrupt me all
the time .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. er .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to thank you on behalf of
Miss Blackburn .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>Uproarious laughter drowned him out.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you all! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, I see.
I mean the lady beside me, m-m-m-my w-w-w-wife.
The late Miss Blackburn .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.”</p>

<p>Renewed laughter.</p>

<p>“Oh, to hell with you!” said Conacher plumping
down in his seat laughing. “If any man thinks he can
make a better speech let’s hear it!”</p>

<p>Next morning they resumed their work on the river.
For two weeks longer they toiled up through or
around the innumerable rapids, canyons, whirlpools,
and waterfalls of the upper Sinclair, before they
finally arrived at the little lake in which it took its
source.</p>

<p>Here Langmuir gave Conacher leave to press on
ahead while the party cleaned up its work for the
season. So Conacher, Loseis and Mary-Lou crossed
a famous pass and descending the mountain on the
other side, plunged all at once into the civilization
which Loseis had never seen. Everything in the
busy little coast town was strange to her; the close
ranks of shops and houses; locomotives; automobiles;
electric light and water from a tap. The Princess was
too aristocratic in spirit to betray vulgar amazement;
she merely looked and listened quietly. Not until
she was alone with her husband did she reveal the
wonder and astonishment of her childish heart. For
the man it was a wonderful experience to introduce so
fresh and ardent a soul to the great world.</p>

<p>There was a short voyage by sea; then the return
eastward by railroad over the mountains to the city of
Prince George.</p>

<p>In Prince George they had no difficulty in finding
John Gruber, who when he was not running Blackburn’s
outfit into the country, or bringing out his
furs, ran a stable in town, and bought and sold horses.
They found him in his little office, a tall, strong man
with a heavy, honest red face, and a bald red poll
surrounded by a fringe of red hair. Gruber had not
visited Blackburn’s Post since Loseis was a child; and
he did not immediately recognize her.</p>

<p>“I am Laurentia Blackburn,” she said.</p>

<p>“What!” cried Gruber, staring. “Why .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. of
course you are! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Well, I’m damned!”</p>

<p>“That’s what everybody says!” said Loseis with a
rueful smile.</p>

<p>“Where did you come from?” demanded Gruber.</p>

<p>Loseis started to tell her story, but Gruber instantly
silenced her. “Wait! Wait!” he cried. “We
must do everything regular and proper!” Snatching
up his hat, he hustled them through the streets to a
tall office building. Here after ascending in an elevator
(a fresh marvel to Loseis) they burst unceremoniously
into the private office of a little, round,
white-haired old gentleman, startling him almost out
of his wits.</p>

<p>“Here is Blackburn’s daughter!” shouted Gruber.</p>

<p>“God bless my soul!” cried the old gentleman,
agitatedly removing his glasses. “What proof have
you of that?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got the proof of my own eyes!”</p>

<p>“Quietly! Quietly!” pleaded the old soul. “Sit
down all. Let us proceed in due order if you please.”</p>

<p>It turned out that this was Hector Blackburn’s
lawyer, David Chichester. In simple graphic sentences,
Loseis told the two men her story, while they
glanced at each other in astonishment, and murmured
in indignation and sympathy.</p>

<p>When she had come to the end, Mr. Chichester said
gravely: “We all felt that there was something that
needed to be explained; but we had nothing to go on.”</p>

<p>“You have later news than mine,” said Loseis
eagerly; “Mr. Gruber has been into the country and
out again. What has happened?”</p>

<p>The two men looked at each other again. Gruber
said: “Show her the newspaper, Mr. Chichester.
That tells the whole story.”</p>

<p>From a drawer of his desk, Mr. Chichester produced
a copy of the local newspaper now some weeks
old, folded in such a manner as to bring into prominence
the story that he desired them to read. They
were instantly aware of the staring headlines:</p>

</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p>Loseis and Conacher read with their heads close
together:</p>

<p>“John Gruber, the well-known horse-dealer and
traveler of Prince George, returned yesterday from his
annual trip into northern Athabasca bringing news of
a strange and poignant tragedy at Blackburn’s Post,
a distant trading station in the unexplored portion of
the province.</p>

<p>“For many years Mr. Gruber has acted as agent
for Hector Blackburn, the last of the powerful free
traders, who maintained an almost baronial state in
the midst of his vast domain. Each year it has been
Mr. Gruber’s custom to take in the year’s supplies for
the Post. At a point about half way he would meet
the outfit sent out by Hector Blackburn and exchange
the store goods for the season’s catch of furs. This
year Mr. Gruber waited in vain at the rendezvous.
After several weeks had passed, a rumor reached
him that Hector Blackburn had been killed by an accident
early in June. He then pushed through the rest
of the way to Blackburn’s Post.</p>

<p>“He found Mr. Andrew Gault of Fort Good Hope,
one of the best-known fur traders in the country, in
charge there. Mr. Gault was well-nigh prostrated
by a terrible happening which had taken place only
two or three days before Mr. Gruber’s arrival. Laurentia
Blackburn, the late trader’s only child, had
killed herself by leaping from a high cliff into the
river, in company with her lover, a young man named
Paul Conacher attached to the Geological Survey.</p>

<p>“It was on June third that Hector Blackburn was
killed by a fall from his horse. His death left his
daughter, a young girl, entirely alone and unprotected
in that savage spot. There were no other white
persons at Blackburn’s Post. Moreover it was surrounded
by a tribe of ignorant Indians who began
to get out of hand as soon as the firm control of
Hector Blackburn was removed. Mr. Gault, hearing
of these things, immediately rode to the girl’s assistance
from his Post one hundred and fifty miles away.</p>

<p>“At first the girl evinced nothing but gratitude at
his coming. She freely put all her affairs into Mr.
Gault’s experienced hands, giving him a power of attorney
to transact the necessary business. Mr. Gault
sent out for Hector Blackburn’s attorney who is the
well-known lawyer, Mr. David Chichester, of this
city; but this letter unluckily was lost somewhere on
the long journey.</p>

<p>“A few days later the young man, Conacher, turned
up at Blackburn’s Post. He too had heard of Blackburn’s
death, and was attracted by the rich prize
offered in his only child and heiress. A handsome
young man, of good address, his conquest of the inexperienced
girl was all too easy. Conacher wished
to get her business into his own hands, and so worked
upon her mind with base insinuations that she turned
against her best friend, Mr. Gault.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gault meanwhile, as was clearly his duty, was
preparing to send out the season’s fur to Mr. Gruber.
By every means in his power, Conacher sought to prevent
this. He was finally guilty of the murder of an
Indian named Etzooah, a messenger of Mr. Gault’s,
under circumstances of peculiar atrocity. The Indian
was garroted as he rode through the woods, by a
line stretched across the trail by Conacher. It then
became Mr. Gault’s duty to apprehend the young man
and send him out to justice. But the infatuated girl
sheltered him in her own house; and standing at the
door with a gun, dared Mr. Gault to come and take
him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Gault sent out for the police; and in the
meantime contented himself with watching the house
to prevent the murderer’s escape. His messenger,
taking a different route, passed Mr. Gruber on the
way in; and as a matter of fact the police arrived two
days after Gruber. But everything was over then.
On the third night Conacher and the girl escaped
from the house, and obtaining possession of a dug-out,
fled across the river. Closely pursued by Mr. Gault,
they sought a refuge on top of a high cut-bank opposite
the Post. When their pursuers closed in on
them, seeing capture, disgrace and separation ahead,
they joined hands and with a weird good-by ringing
through the night, leaped over the edge of the
gravelly cliff and were drowned in the river below.
Though Mr. Gault searched for the bodies for many
days, they were not found.</p>

<p>“The police conducted an investigation into the
sad circumstances. As a result, Sergeant Ferrie in
charge of the detail expressed himself as satisfied that
Mr. Gault had done all that any man could do in such
an inexpressibly distressing situation. Mr. Gault remains
in charge of the Post until such time as the
Courts may issue letters of administration. No heirs
are known.”</p>

<p>Conacher and Loseis looked at each other in amazement.</p>

<p>“By Heaven! what an infernally clever story!”
cried Conacher. “I am not surprised that even the
police were taken in.”</p>

<p>“God brought us through all our dangers especially
so that we could show this man up!” said Loseis.</p>

<p>“We must decide on a course of action,” said Mr.
Chichester fussily.</p>

<p>“There can be but one course for my husband and
me,” said Loseis quickly. “We will start back for
our Post to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Naturally,” said Conacher.</p>

<p>The other two looked a little flabbergasted at this
instant decision.</p>

<p>“The season is growing late,” objected Gruber.
“Light snows have already fallen. Ice will be running
in the rivers by the time you get there.”</p>

<p>“But the trip <span class='it'>can</span> be made!” said Loseis.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, it can be made.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll make it.”</p>

<p>“One moment,” said Mr. Chichester dryly. “I suppose
you know that you have other property beside
the fur business.”</p>

<p>“Have I?” said Loseis.</p>

<p>He handed her a sort of statement from amongst
his papers. Loseis looked at it, and shook her head.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand it,” she said, passing it to Conacher.</p>

<p>As he studied it, Conacher’s face paled. “Good
God!” he muttered. “According to this you are
worth over a million dollars.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Oh, after what
they have said about me, this is terrible!”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to make the best of it!” said Mr.
Chichester with a dry twinkle.</p>

<p>Loseis showed a face of quaint distress. “My
dear Paul,” she murmured, “I’m so sorry! So sorry!
I didn’t know anything about it. It wasn’t my
fault, was it!”</p>

<hr class='tbk'/>

<p>Gruber, who headed the party, breathed with relief
when he led them through a pass in the hills
down to the edge of the wide meadows surrounding
Blackburn’s Lake. October had come in; and
during their long ride across the prairie they had
met with more than one snow-storm. Fortunately
for them the snow had melted; had it remained lying
on the prairie, or had they experienced one of the
early blizzards that are not unknown at this season,
their position would have been serious. Now, with
the shelter of the timber at hand, they were safe.</p>

<p>The party was well outfitted of course; but even
so, what with the snow, the hard frosts at night and
the raw, biting winds by day, traveling had been intensely
disagreeable. They carried a small tent for
the two women. Gruber had three hot-heads in his
company who could not brook the slightest delay.
Besides Loseis and Conacher there was young Sergeant
Ferrie of the Mounted Police who was no less
eager than the other two to bring down retribution
on the head of Andrew Gault. The policeman’s professional
pride had been wounded. With three
troopers he had joined the party at the Crossing.
Mary-Lou was also of the party; and six Cree half-breeds
from Miwasa Landing. They had upwards
of twenty horses.</p>

<p>They slept for the last time on the same little point
of high land running out into the meadows, where
Conacher had been surprised by Etzooah four months
before. The days were growing short now. About
eleven o’clock next morning they were riding past the
Slavi village on the opposite side of the river. The
inhabitants lined up to watch them pass, in silent
consternation. Even at the distance they could not
have failed to recognize Loseis and the famous yellow
head of Conacher.</p>

<p>“Some of them could jump in a canoe and get to
the Post with the aid of the current before we
could,” suggested Conacher.</p>

<p>“They have no love for Gault,” said Loseis.
“There is no reason why they should warn them.
The Slavis never look for trouble.”</p>

<p>“Even if he should be warned, he’s got nowhere
to run except back to his own Post,” Gruber pointed
out. “And there he’d only run into the arms of the
other party of police who went down the big river.”</p>

<p>“Just the same,” said Sergeant Ferrie, frowning,
“I’ve no intention of letting any other party take
him. He belongs to me!”</p>

<p>They urged their weary horses on a little faster.</p>

<p>Suspecting that Gault might make a dash for freedom
at the sight of them, Ferrie determined to send
a party across country to head him off on the other
trail. Two of the white troopers and two Crees were
allotted to this duty. They turned off on the same
ridge a mile from the Post that Gault had used. In
order to give them time to reach their post, the rest
of the party halted for their midday meal in the hollow
beyond.</p>

<p>When they started out again, Ferrie took command.
He wished Loseis and Mary-Lou to remain
in that spot with a guard; but Loseis would not hear
of it. Much to her disgust she was forced to bring
up the rear of the train. As they came in sight of
the Post the men’s faces were grim. It had a deserted
look. Gault had never succeeded in persuading
the Slavis to return, and the grassy meadow below
the buildings, yellow now, was empty. When
they cantered up into the little square within the
buildings, that was empty too: Women’s House,
store, warehouses, Blackburn’s House; doors closed
and chimneys cold. The bars of the corral were
down.</p>

<p>The men paused to consult. Presently the sound
of approaching hoofs was heard; and the four men
sent across country rode into the square, driving before
them four mounted Indians, who were immediately
recognizable as belonging to Gault; one of
them indeed was Watusk, whom Loseis and Conacher
had good cause to remember. He was brought up
to Sergeant Ferrie.</p>

<p>“Where is Gault?” demanded the policeman.</p>

<p>“We leave him here, half hour ago,” answered
Watusk sullenly. “He tell us to go home.”</p>

<p>“Told you to go home!” said Ferrie, astonished.</p>

<p>“He know you are coming,” Watusk went on impassively.
“This man Hooliam,” pointing to one of
his companions, “was at the Slavi village to see a girl
when you ride past. He jomp in a canoe and paddle
fas’ to tell Gault that Blackburn’s daughter and Yellowhead
are not dead. They are comin’ back with
four red-coats.”</p>

<p>“What did Gault say to that?” Ferrie asked with
a hard smile.</p>

<p>“He jus’ smile,” said Watusk. “He look on the
groun’ and tap his leg with his little whip. Bam-bye
he say: ‘All right, boys. Get your horses and ride
home. I will wait here for them.’ And we go.”</p>

<p>“Then he’s still here!” cried Ferrie.</p>

<p>Watusk pointed to Blackburn’s house.</p>

<p>“Gault! Come out!” cried Ferrie in a strong
voice.</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>Ferrie tried the door of the house, and found it
barred on the inside. He signified to his men that
they were to fetch one of the heavy poles from the
corral. Using it as a battering-ram, after two or
three blows, the door burst in. Ferrie and Conacher
entered the house together.</p>

<p>They found Gault sitting upright in the kitchen in
one of Blackburn’s carved chairs. For one dreadful
instant they thought that he was laughing at them;
in the next they perceived that he was dead. His
wide-open eyes were bereft of all sense; his lower jaw
was hanging down in a dreadful, idiotic grimace. Yet
he sat as straight in the high-backed chair as in life.
It was only upon looking closer that they discovered
that the man with a strange, last impulse of vanity
had tied himself into the chair, that he might be discovered
facing his enemies in an upright position.
There was a band of canvas around his chest! and another
around his forehead; the broad-brimmed Stetson
was jammed rakishly down on his head over the
band. He had then shot himself through the heart
with a revolver, which had slipped from his hand to
the floor.</p>

<p>The young men jerked their hats off; and their
grim faces softened a little.</p>

<p>“Well, he’s paid,” said Conacher. “We can’t feel
any more hard feelings against him!”</p>

<p>“It’s better so,” said Ferrie. “Nobody would
want this ugly case advertised by a trial.”</p>

<p>Such was Andrew Gault’s requiem.</p>

<p>They returned outside the house, hat in hand, and
all the others knew at a glance what they had found.</p>

<p>If Gault in his strange preparations for death had
hoped to leave upon Loseis a last impression of his
power, his aim was not realized. She betrayed no
wish to look at him again. Loseis’ verdict was more
merciful than the young men’s.</p>

<p>“So he is dead!” she murmured, clinging to Conacher’s
arm. “He <span class='it'>would</span> kill himself, of course.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
Poor fellow! He had never known love when he was
young. When he was old love mocked him, and it
drove him mad.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Ah! how lucky <span class='it'>we</span> are, my
dearest dear!”</p>

<p>They returned to the house across the way where
they had known such dreadful days and nights. But
the spell of dread was lifted now. Their breasts were
calm and free.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
